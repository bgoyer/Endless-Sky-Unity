As you begin walking away together, he adds in a quieter voice, Normally a fresh pilot like you with no combat reputation would never be offered a mission like this, so try not to mess things up. Remember that we don't have to kill the pirates, all we have to do is make sure the convoy isn't destroyed.

I recognize that look on your face - it's the same one I had after my first job like this back when I was a beginner. If I recall, my first priority after touching down was replacing some of the ship's guns with missile launchers so I'd actually have a chance against pirates. It's a scandal how they sell interceptors with nothing but short-ranged energy weapons these days; trying to use them in combat on such a small ship is practically suicide. Keep your distance with some missiles and you can almost never go wrong. Anyway, I'll stop rambling.

And one heavy rocket hit could nearly disable you. Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances, or at least not with weapons that can fit in a Sparrow. So, don't risk it.

The Dirt Belt can only produce food and people can only eat it so fast, so change up your trade routes if you notice the return getting worse.`",
