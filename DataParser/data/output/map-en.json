            "Description": "`This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.``Ada is the home planet of Lovelace Labs, one of the most highly respected designers of starship systems and weaponry. Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs and the many other industrial companies here.`` From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren. Most of the major cities on Ada are built into the walls of the canyons, where they are protected from the high winds and occasional dust storms that sweep across the surface.``The homeworld of the Arach people, Ahr is a metropolitan world with nearly nine billion inhabitants, enough that they cannot all be fed by what this world produces. The government maintains a storehouse with a month's supply of food in each major metropolitan center, as well as a collection of bioreactors, built according to Kimek designs, that can produce a tasteless but nutritious paste as emergency rations in the unlikely event that shipments of food from off-world are somehow disrupted for a prolonged period of time.``Albatross is a cold ocean world orbiting a small, cold sun. The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`` The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.``At the height of the Alpha War, the government of the Deep constructed Alexandria as the galaxy's largest storehouse of human literature, scientific writing, and technology. It also houses a vast museum of cultural artifacts dating back to long before the start of the space age. Today the station is mostly populated by visitors looking for particularly arcane writings or information, and librarians who have devoted their lives to keeping the archives well-indexed and up to date.`` Entire sections of the station are off limits to ordinary visitors. There are many rumors about what those restricted areas contain.``Alfheim is a world of wide grassy plains, deserts, a few small oceans, and scattered rainforests. Not a pleasant enough planet to support large cities, it is instead mostly a site for oil drilling and manufacturing. So far only a tiny fraction of the surface has been developed, mostly clustered around the sites where the largest oil deposits have been discovered.`` Settlements show up as small bright points on the dark side of the planet - not from city lights, but from natural gas burnoff at the drilling stations.``Alix is a small moon the Creators were stripping to build the Het station, as well as to produce the Ka'het hulls. Every inhabited settlement was completely destroyed, but some of the automatic mining facilities and drones that replenish the station's reserves seem to have survived and are still active today.`` This could mean the Ka'het developed some sort of basic intelligence, or simply that their scanners weren't good enough to detect the drones.``This Earth-like planet has been settled both by human beings and by the Hai, the species that controls this region of space. The human settlements are relatively small, mostly farming communities founded by people who came here to escape the chaos and uncertainty of human space.``This is a complete Quarg ringworld, the product of millennia of construction effort which has consumed every other stellar object in this system in order to provide the raw materials. The inner edge of the ring is filled with solar panels, hydroponic gardens, living quarters, and sunlit common spaces. The outer edge contains hangars and docks for ships, and storage facilities for cargo.`` Massive station-keeping thrusters on the ring's exterior keep its orbit from becoming unstable.``Amazon is a lush, green, tropical world, a popular tourist destination for many who live in this region of space. The indigenous forests are dense and hardy enough that growing human crops here is a constant battle, and none of the native plants or fruits are edible. Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining.`` The forests are home to a stunning variety of wildlife, some of it dangerous but most of it entirely indifferent to human presence. Plant life is so abundant here that even the oceans are green rather than blue, teeming with kelp and algae.``Antipode is a world of creeping glaciers and year-round snow, orbiting far enough from a dim star that even when the sun breaks through the clouds, it brings little warmth. The few settlements that exist here are built near surface deposits of rare earth metals that were discovered recently, and that are mined for use in electronics and equipment throughout this sector.`` The inhabitants of Antipode are among the best downhill skiers in the galaxy, and they have made some attempts to draw off-world tourists to the ski resorts here, but the weather is so hostile that they have had very little success.``Arabia is an uncomfortably hot and humid world of deserts, savanna, and a few small and scattered rainforests. Large herds of bison-like animals roam the plains, providing the locals with a steady source of food. Occasional stampedes, involving tens of thousands of these animals, have been known to level entire towns here.`` Aside from hunting, most of the industry takes the form of harvesting and refining petrochemicals to make plastics, polymers, and oils. In some parts of Arabia, the pumpjacks outnumber the people a hundred to one.``Arachne Station is privately owned by Tarazed Corporation, and there are no services available here for people who are not Tarazed employees.``Now that the Korath are gone, the oceans on this planet have begun to teem with fish and other living creatures once again, and the levels of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide are slowly swinging back into balance. Species of algae and bacteria that are able to metabolize the plastics and chemicals that the Korath left behind have spread throughout the oceans.``Asgard was one of the first worlds to be settled in the Deep. It is now home to many crowded cities, with soaring skyscrapers that are made of lightweight composite materials rather than the steel and cement so commonly used elsewhere.`` This is also the home of Deep Sky, a manufacturing firm that produces a wide variety of expensive and useful starship equipment.``The thin, unbreathable atmosphere and low gravity mean that Ashy Reach will never become popular as a residential world, but it serves a useful role as a hub for shipping and commercial exchange. There is only one settlement here, built around the spaceport, and consisting mostly of pressurized underground caverns. Outside the settlement, the planet's surface is drab and almost lifeless.``This is a pristine and perfectly habitable world, with warm oceans and a temperate climate. The land is dominated by large reptiles similar to the dinosaurs that roamed the continents of ancient Earth. Some of the land reptiles are over twenty meters in length, and the sea holds monsters more than twice that size.`` Deep in the jungles near the equator, small mammals are working hard to avoid being eaten by the great lizards, and to survive for long enough that they will be able to evolve into the dominant life form.``This is not a particularly warm world, but it is the best that the first Remnant refugees were able to find when they explored the Ember Waste. It is here that they built their capital, in a deep valley that is almost always shrouded in clouds. In meadows farther up the mountain slopes, a few particularly hardy food crops are grown, but for the most part the Remnant rely on artificial greenhouses or cultured yeast for protein supplements. Remnant cuisine is unlikely to ever become a draw for tourists, even if their isolation here is broken.``This idyllic planet is home to almost as many Arachi as their homeworld in the neighboring system. It is also home to House Plumtab, the Arach guild in charge of banks and finance. Because pretty much every other sector of the Arach economy depends on loans from House Plumtab and trades stock on their equity exchanges, this House is quite influential throughout Arach space.``Although it is in Arach territory, Belug's Plunge is a cold enough planet that most of the native population is Saryds rather than Arachi. Most of the industry here focuses on mining metals and exotic elements to be used in building new extensions to the Rings. There is also a Saryd materials research lab trying to learn how to duplicate the advanced composites used by the Quarg. But Belug's Plunge is best known for the Academy, where cadets for the Heliarch defense forces are trained.``Big Sky is a warm and fertile world, teeming with indigenous life. It would be an ideal farming world if it were not for the fact that the native plants are so abundant and so well adapted to this environment that they can take over an untended field in a matter of months. Farmers typically start the growing season by slashing and burning the plants that have taken root in their fields over the winter, and even so they must be constantly vigilant for weeds throughout the summer.`` The Big Sky government recently financed a major project to genetically engineer a goat species so ravenous that it can control the growth of local vegetation. These ubergoats pose so great a threat to the typical biosphere that they are export-controlled as biological weapons.``Bivrost is the one planet in the Deep where heavy metals are relatively abundant. What began as a mining colony has developed into one of the most prosperous worlds in the region. Unlike most worlds that are strip mined for uranium, the environment outside the cities is relatively unspoiled. Strict controls are placed on the emissions and waste products of the local manufacturing plants to ensure that it stays that way.``Bloodsea is nearly uninhabited, except for a few pirate outposts. Its name comes from the planet's oceans, which are blood-red due to rhodophyte algae. Although the climate is temperate and there are many white sand beaches, no one comes here hoping to go swimming.`` The pirates have no industry of their own, but instead make a living by reselling stolen cargo from raids on merchant fleets.``The surface of Bloptab's Furnace is rich in mineral deposits but too hot for any but the hardiest plants and insects to survive. The locals live deep underground in caverns carved out by the same automated mining machines that are used for collecting ore on the surface. When maintenance is needed for the surface robots, crews of engineers will wait until nightfall and then emerge from underground and do their best to complete the repairs before sunrise.``Dozens of small cities dot the valleys and hilltops of this warm and pleasant forest world. Due to a high tech manufacturing industry, there is plenty of work here for all the inhabitants, who hail from planets throughout Coalition space. With broad streets, ample parks, and gleaming skyscrapers, the cities bear witness to the very best of what Coalition society can accomplish when the three species work together.``Blue Interior is a strikingly beautiful earthlike world, covered mostly in oceans but with regions of rainforest, desert, mountains, and frozen tundra. Billions of Kimek live here, and there are also large Saryd and Arach populations in the cities whose climates are most agreeable to them. The Coalition often presents this world as a model of how their three species can benefit from sharing space with each other.``The sunlight that filters through Bluestone's atmosphere is too dim and reddish for ordinary Earth plants to thrive. The native plants, mostly grasses and lichens, have adapted their own unique chlorophyll-like molecules in response.`` Bluestone is sparsely populated. Aside from one small research village dedicated to cultivating edible hybrid crops that can grow on similar worlds, most of the industry here is focused on drilling and refining oil to make a variety of plastics.``All the land near Bounty's equator is desert, but closer to the poles, the weather is temperate and there is enough rain for farming. The land near the northern pole is sparsely populated, but the other hemisphere is quite well developed, with many of the inhabitants now working in factories that produce fancy watches and intricate electronic components.`` The focus on skilled manufacturing has had a dramatic effect on both the local education system and the sports scene. One can garner great respect - and a sizable income - simply by being the best at folding tiny paper cranes by microscope.``Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled four centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet.`` Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some coastal regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands.``This is a farming world. In the century prior to their discovery of space flight, billions of Kimek starved in a series of increasingly severe global famines. Fourteen thousand years later, their culture is still haunted by fear of not having enough food, and in response they have developed enough farms in their region of space to feed a population three times their size. Much of the food that they produce each year is either put into storage or simply recycled back into fertilizer for next year's crop.``This is the first world that the Saryds colonized outside of their own solar system. Although somewhat colder than their native planet, it developed into a thriving metropolitan world. The original settlers planned out in exacting detail how every part of the planet's land mass should be used, in order to satisfy their aesthetic ideal of blending residential areas with parks and farms. Large areas have also been set aside as undeveloped wilderness.``Pirates who have struck it rich dream of retiring on Buccaneer Bay. It is a warm ocean planet, with many places reminiscent of the islands in the ancient Caribbean where humanity's first pirate fleets sailed.`` Many of the inhabitants are in fact not pirates, but their descendants, and these children and grand-children of anarchist outlaws have built a system of regional government that oversees hospitals, schools, and other public services, all created without funding from the Republic or taxes paid to it. The planet even sports its own shipyard, although many of the ships built here are, not surprisingly, based on designs pirated from the Syndicate and Republic shipyards.``Burthen is only sparsely populated due to crushingly high gravity. The locals - exceptionally strong and short - take a stoic pride in this misery and the many health issues that result. The land in most regions is suitable for farming, but mining of heavy metals is the primary industry, and the source of ready wealth that ties people to this uncomfortable planet.`` Some of the excavation vehicles used here are as large and costly as a capital starship and as noisy as a volcano. Vast scars of strip mines span across the landscape. On this planet the environment is something to be endured rather than cherished.``When the first members of the Remnant discovered this region of space, Caelian was the only habitable world they found with enough insolation to be able to operate solar-powered factories and bioreactors. The first settlements were scattered widely, with the houses hidden underground in order to be less visible from space, because they feared that the Alphas would overrun human space and eventually find their way into the Waste. Centuries later, when they learned that the Alpha Wars had ended, they began to expand the factories and settlements more openly.``Calda is a tropical resort world, a pleasant place to unwind after a few days skiing on its sister planet, Vail. The most popular tourist destination is the hot springs, and the spa complexes that have been built up around them. Constant pesticide use has nearly eliminated insect pests. Because of the uncomfortably warm and humid summer months, the very rich view Calda more as a tourist destination than as a place to live.`` In Calda's early days as a spa planet, a nearly silent eruption of carbon dioxide filled a resort valley and suffocated the whole population. This incident shocked the Paradise Worlds and led to a very large drop in tourism here. Fortunately for Calda's economy, this effect ceased within six months, which was about how long it took for most potential tourists to forget about the incident.``Canyon is a large world, with gravity near the high end of what human beings can comfortably bear. Much of its surface is sandstone, leading scientists to believe that the planet was once home to large oceans, before some cataclysmic event, perhaps a rogue star drifting through the system, caused much of the planet's water to boil away. The few settlers who live here mostly farm the deep canyons; the mesas above are dry and almost lifeless.`` The angular rock formations that cover most of the mesa land are identified in local mythology as the ruins of an unspeakably vast and ancient alien city. A gullible tourist can find any number of opportunities to tour these alleged sites. Off-world science has been largely skeptical of these claims.``Carbuncle is a tiny station owned and operated by Lovelace Labs. You assume that like most such stations, it is primarily a deuterium refinery, but aside from the docking bay the rest of the station is closed off to visitors. Given the reputation of Lovelace Labs for exotic research, there could be almost anything beyond those sealed-off bulkheads.``The Saryds prefer to build their largest factories on sun-drenched, uninhabitable worlds, in order to allow more hospitable planets to be used for residences and recreation. Where possible, their factories harness solar power: either using mirrors to concentrate sunlight for solar foundries, or collecting energy through large fields of solar panels. The factories are almost entirely maintained by robots, which are capable not only of repairing damage but also of constructing entire new factories according to predefined plans.`` The solar collectors are mounted on frames about ten meters above the shifting sand dunes. In addition to turning to face the sun, they can be turned upside-down as necessary to dump off any sand that accumulates on them.``Celeatis is a mountainous planet, once home to one of the largest Builder research centers. They were focused on studying the anomaly in the system. If they found out how to stabilize and use it as a wormhole, perhaps their species would have survived, spreading to the rest of the galaxy; the ruined, lifeless and half-buried buildings here are evidence of their failure.`` The planet's surface is too irregular and far from the system's stars to be suitable for farming, so its inhabitants had to rely on the food produced abroad. When the Ka'het came, the supplies stopped arriving. In less than a year the planetary food reserves were depleted and the whole population had died of starvation.``Celestial Third is the breadbasket of Kimek space. Most of its land mass is used for farming, augmented by seaweed farms and fisheries in the oceans and factories near the equator producing yeast and bacterial cultures as nutritional supplements. The first settlers came here more than thirteen thousand years ago, at a time when their home world had run out of arable land for farming and food was desperately needed.``This station used to act as some sort of anti-missile platform. It is covered in a large number of defensive turrets capable of shooting down even the strongest of torpedoes. During the Ka'het invasion it must have been able to stop the incoming EMPs, but it had no way to defend itself against the Ravager Beams; the crew quarters were completely destroyed by the Ka'het, and the Builders soon lost control of all the station's defense systems.`` Given the location of the station, it's likely that it was originally built to stop everything coming out of the wormhole rather than the Ka'het themselves.``The world that suffered the heaviest damage during the invasion was probably Veliante. Here, one of the earliest attacks hit some sort of nuclear facility, starting a meltdown; the fallout quickly spread across most of the planet, leaving all Builder settlements uninhabitable. While most of the planet has returned to safe level of radiation, the areas around the ancient facility are still too irradiated to survive for long without some form of protective equipment.``Charon Station provides hyperspace fuel for much of the southern galactic rim. It is a tiny, cramped, and aging station, with twice as many workers here as it was originally designed for. Centuries ago, before much of the Dirt Belt was settled, this was the first spot below Algorel where merchant caravan fleets from the Deep could stop over on their way to the worlds farther up the Rim.`` The close quarters have fostered an extreme scrupulosity about personal space. It is unnerving to walk down a densely crowded hallway and fail to make eye contact with anyone.``Charybdis Station is privately owned by the Syndicate. It is a massive deuterium refinery, with harvester drones constantly flying in and out to scoop hydrogen gas out of the upper atmosphere of the planet below. If you need to repair or refuel in this system, you will need to visit the neighboring world of Delve, instead of this station.``Chiron is the only planet outside the solar system that was colonized by humanity prior to the discovery of the hyperdrive. It is now the second most populous planet in the Republic, with many sprawling cities and a burgeoning pollution problem.`` Although Earth still has the most prestigious universities in the galaxy, Chiron has become the de-facto leader of the higher education industry, catering to those who value excellent teaching more highly than an illustrious name. As a result, off-world students form a noticeable fraction of the population.``The Saryds established a trading colony here in the early days of their era of space exploration, when they first made contact with the Quarg. When the Quarg gave them the gift of a small number of jump drives, in order to build relationships with the neighboring species, Chosen Nexus grew into a far larger and more important trading hub.`` It has now been many millennia since the Quarg were driven out and free travel began between the members of the Coalition, and Chosen Nexus now has nearly as many Arach and Kimek inhabitants as native Saryds.``Clark is a recently settled world, and most of its surface remains covered in dense forests and uninhabited mountains. Because clearing new land is so difficult, agriculture here has not grown far beyond the level of subsistence farming. But the temperate climate has drawn several million settlers, most of whom work in factories that have been planted here by off-world corporations to take advantage of the cheap labor.`` The low cost of living and virtually zero unemployment rate make poverty and crime relatively rare occurrences. Instead there is a pioneering spirit, a startup-world attitude that anything is attainable with a bit of hard work and frugality.``About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air.`` The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships.``Cloudfire's atmosphere is unusually hazy, with almost constant cloud cover, making agriculture unproductive here even though it is a warm and damp environment. There are several major cities here that were abandoned centuries ago, due to conflict with the Unfettered. The one major city that remains is the closest thing the Hai have to a military base, with new supplies of weapons and ammunition constantly pouring in from the rest of Hai space.``In the early mornings on Cold Horizon, the trees are often coated in a thin layer of glittering frost that burns away a few hours after sunrise. In the short summer season, flocks of migratory birds arrive in the forest, bringing a cacophony of music and a riot of color to the otherwise serene woodlands.`` Half a billion Saryds live here, drawn not so much by the planet's resources, which are scarce, as by its natural beauty.``Much of Cool Forest's land mass is covered by the sort of temperate woodlands that the Saryds prefer to build their residential neighborhoods in. The total population is over a billion, but living in small settlements so well integrated with the surrounding forest that from space only a few major cities are visible.``Cornucopia is a mostly agrarian world, and like several of its neighbors it has been inhabited since the early days of interstellar travel, when settlers seeking to get as far as possible from old Earth and its troubles landed here. Through careful stewardship and attention to the rhythms and balances of nature, generation after generation of farmers have transformed this world into one of the most fertile in human space. The Cornucopia College of Agriculture is famous, and justly so.`` From orbit, most of the landmass seems covered with a bizarre pixelated pattern. On approach, this resolves into a vast patchwork of fields and irrigation circles.``The Corral of Meblumem is home to two major industries: uranium mining, and longcow ranching. The long lifetime of the longcows means that their bodies can easily accumulate dangerous loads of heavy metals if exposed to them, so the two industries are kept separated by conservation zones dozens of kilometers wide. The dark strips of primal forests separating the red-brown pit mines from the tan and light green of the pastures makes the land look like a stained-glass patchwork from above.``Covert is home to a powerful mining cartel, operating outside the control of Republic law or any other external authority. It is rumored to be one of the few planets in human space where weapons-grade uranium and plutonium is mined and enriched. Any goods for sale here were most likely produced by slave labor, often by survivors of ships that have been captured by pirates. A massive pirate fleet is docked on the outskirts of the spaceport, a warning to any private pilot who might think of cheating or opposing the cartel.``Crossroads is a thoroughly unbeautiful planet. The scrawny local vegetation has blue and purple leaves, shocking to your human eyes, and grows only reluctantly, leaving the land looking like a blighted wasteland.`` The Syndicate's vast operation strip mining for uranium ore does nothing to improve this situation. They say that sandstorms were frequent here even before the Syndicate arrived, but the storms have gotten far worse in recent years, with some storms now reaching several kilometers high and dozens of kilometers in diameter.``Dancer is a resource-rich world, but with unusually violent weather and strong atmospheric convection, which leads to lightning storms stronger than on any other settled human world. Straying outside on foot is unthinkable, and it is not uncommon to find a small crater blasted out by a particularly energetic strike.`` A fair number of scientists have settled here to study the planet's weather systems, as well as others who do not mind, or who even enjoy, the wild weather. It might be possible for terraforming to moderate Dancer's atmospheric activity enough to make it a less dangerous place to live, but the cost would be prohibitive.``Darkcloak is a world that is almost always obscured by a thick layer of clouds, making it difficult to produce food here.`` Although the Hai tend to be an easygoing and nonviolent species, there are always a few in each generation that yearn for excitement, warfare, and conquest. These Unfettered Hai have built a major military base here, and they launch raids from here on convoys traveling through the nearby systems.``Darkmetal is a cold, dry mining world, the source of much of the heavy metals that are used in Hai space. A haze of slightly radioactive dust hangs in the sky whenever it has been more than a week since the last rainstorm. Most of the mining is carried out by slow-moving vehicles the size of a small city, which ingest layers of dirt and bedrock, crush it to extract any valuable elements, then mix the remaining material with water to form a cement-like slurry that can be extruded in solid blocks, to reduce the amount of additional dust that is added to the atmosphere.``Darkstone is a rainy, mountainous planet. The major continents are spidered with rivers and green valleys. A few enterprising settlers have built farming communities here, but the population remains low because of the threat of piracy from neighboring systems.`` Among the farmers who choose to stay, the attitude seems to be that piracy can't last forever, but good land will always be good land. Despite some low-level cynicism and bitterness, there is surprisingly little outright anger at either the pirates themselves or any government that might have been expected to control them.``This planet seems to have all the conditions necessary for a vibrant, Earth-like ecology. The gravity and temperature are moderate, and there is a fair amount of surface water, although the oceans are quite small. However, aside from a few stunted plants and lichen, there is almost no native life here. Given how skilled the Hai appear to be at terraforming other worlds, it is strange that this one has been left barren.``Deadman's Cove is an ocean planet; the continents take up only a tenth of its surface area. Legends tell of massive sea creatures hiding in the deeps: serpents hundreds of meters long; colossal sea turtles; strange tentacled monsters and exotic fish.`` One island archipelago is home to the spaceport, the only part of the planet where it is safe to land uninvited. The other islands - even some that seem from a distance to be uninhabited - are often used as staging bases for pirate fleets, who guard their secrets closely.``Deep is a sparsely populated world of small island archipelagos surrounded by vast expanses of empty ocean. There is not enough land for any large cities or serious industry to emerge, so most of the inhabitants live in small fishing villages. The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is somewhat dimmer than you are used to.`` The fishing settlements are actually the second colonization attempt on this planet. In the early days of hyperdrive the Kingsburg Corporation sent out what was then one of the largest and most technologically advanced colonization fleets, penetrating deep into the then-unexplored southern galactic rim. After two centuries of sporadic and guarded contact, the colony fell silent, and when human expansion finally reached this area again, no trace of the original colony was found.``Thick layers of kelp and plankton sediment have gathered on the floors of Deep Treasure's oceans over the eons, leaving behind rich deposits of oil that the Saryds harvest to make plastics and other hydrocarbon products. In the shallower seas, shoals of fish swim among some of the most varied and extensive coral reefs found anywhere in Coalition space.``The upper layers of Deep Water's mantle are unusually hot, resulting in continuous volcanic eruptions that shroud its skies in ash and particulate matter. Aside from one small continent most of the surface is ocean, but the volcanoes have formed hundreds of separate island chains and archipelagos, each of which is home to unique plant and animal species.`` To preserve the planet's rich biodiversity, the Saryds do not allow permanent settlements to be built on the islands, but village-sized research stations have been built that can be anchored near an island while scientists work there.``Delve is a world of towering mountains and valleys so steep that some slopes never see the light of the sun, where snow and ice remain on the topmost peaks year-round. The Syndicate's mining operations here are among the most extensive in the region, with some shafts descending several kilometers below the surface. Some of the mines are as large as a city, and in fact many of the mining cities are under ground, built in sections of old mines that have long since run out of useful metals. With all the mines and underground cities reliant on mechanical ventilation from the surface, the miners live in constant fear of two things: cave-ins, and power failures.``This is a mining world, hotter than even the Arach would prefer but still much more habitable than its sister world of Blobtab's Furnace. It is home to House Ablomab, the guild of mining and metalworking, and the dry climate makes it possible to store stockpiles of iron, steel, and other metals here without worrying about rust. Supposedly the warehouses here contain enough raw materials to double the size of the Heliarch war fleet if needed; the Arach like to be able to trust that they are prepared for any eventuality.``Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles. It may be centuries before the skies clear and this world begins to thaw.``The Kor Sestor prefer to develop planets rather than planting stations in space, but this is a necessary exception: a deuterium refinery that harvests hydrogen both from the gas giant it orbits, and from the strong solar wind from this system's primary star.``On this factory world, robotic workers operate the factories, repair themselves, and keep the solar power stations free of sand with very little direction or assistance from their Saryd creators. Each factory complex has its own landing pads for the freighters that drop off raw materials and receive the processed goods.``The haze that perpetually blankets this world is actually an organic soup rich in nutrients and airborne bacteria, and the rain that falls here forms a sort of natural fertilizer. The entire planet's surface, including every quiet nook or alleyway in the cities, is covered in moss, grass, shrubs, or other green and growing things.`` Billions of Kimek live here, working either in the farms or in the mines and factories that operate in the hill country where harvesting crops would be more difficult.``Much of the surface of this world is covered in water. Ships the size of small cities float in the oceans, carried by the tides. The ships are designed to incubate algae and other microorganisms that once provided the Korath both with food and with a source of mixed hydrocarbons similar to petroleum. With the Korath gone and the food no longer needed, many of the ships have fallen into disrepair, or have drifted into the polar regions and been crushed against icebergs.``Dune is a mostly desert world, which was uninhabited until very recently when geologists discovered that the bedrock under the desert is home to many rare mineral deposits and gemstones. Most of the inhabitants live deep underground to avoid the hot sunlight and frequent sandstorms. It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, and to need to call for help from another village. But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world.``Dusk Companion's moon is so large and orbits so close to the planet that the tidal forces even affect the planet's plate tectonics. The skies here are frequently blanketed in a volcanic haze. This world is rich in oil deposits, a relic of a past when more life flourished here, but drilling for oil is costly because the shifting ground can damage drills or seal up previously productive bore-holes.``The surface of this planet, when it is not obscured by dust storms, receives enough sunlight to power not only large solar farms, but solar furnaces as well, which the Hai use for manufacturing a large variety of goods. Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there is almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles.``With a wide band of tropical rainforests around its equator, this planet's climate is ideal for the Arach. Several billion of them live here, and many of the workers assisting with the expansion of the Heliarch ringworlds come from this planet.``The ancestral home world of humanity, Earth has a population twice that of any other inhabited planet. Sprawling cities cover large portions of its surface, many of them overcrowded and dangerous. Some people work to scrape together enough money to leave, while at the same time others, born on distant worlds, make a pilgrimage of sorts to see this planet that once cradled the entirety of the human species.`` Earth is also the capital of the Republic. Representative government becomes complicated when one planet has a greater population than a hundred planets elsewhere. As a result, settlements of less than a million are grouped together into planetary districts that elect a single representative between them - a source of much frustration in the frontier worlds.``The moon of Eavine played a crucial role in the demise of the Builders: here, the second wave of Ka'het was built, making use of the large mineral resources in the planet. They soon found out that what was supposed to change the result of the invasion only accelerated it, overcoming the blockade imposed by the Quarg and allowing the Ka'het to reach their northern systems.`` The Builders had terraformed Eavine to make it a more suitable place to live, but after their civilization collapsed the moon began to return to its natural state, and a few thousand years ago the moon became so cold that the Ka'het production came to an end. As an example of their instability, the Ka'het themselves inflicted superficial damage to most facilities.``This is a small Quarg outpost, which you suspect was built mostly to keep an eye on Tarazed Corporation and their alien-influenced research on the planet below. Like most Quarg worlds, the gravity is much too low here for it to be a feasible human colony, and although there is an atmosphere, it is too thin for a human being to breathe. Supposedly the Quarg have lungs designed for a continuous one way airflow, like a bird's lungs, rather than the ordinary in and out flow of human lungs; this is what enables them to survive on low-gravity, low-atmosphere worlds.`",
            "Spaceport": "`This outpost was really not designed with human beings in mind. The indoor air is not pressurized, so even there you need an oxygen mask to be able to breathe comfortably. And all the rooms and hallways are taller and narrower than you are used to. The station feels like a maze, full of winding passageways with no clear order or pattern to them, although perhaps the order would be readily apparent if you had an alien mind.`",

            "Description": "`You have no idea what has happened to this planet, and you are not sure you want to know. The atmosphere is unusually hot and wet for a planet this distance from its sun, and the ocean levels seem to have dropped significantly in the recent past, leaving barnacles and bleached coral exposed to the air all around the shorelines. The wind is frenzied and full of wild energy, and the fog moves like a living creature.``The Kor Mereti robots seem to prefer to build their factories and refineries in space rather than on planets, harvesting their raw materials from asteroids so that they do not have to deal with gravity, or atmosphere, or rain, or sandstorms. They have left this desert world unoccupied.`` The deserts here are home to an unusual number of plant species, which have adapted to survive the occasional catastrophic flash floods.``This Kor Mereti outpost is far enough from the front in their war with the Kor Sestor that it has fallen somewhat into disuse. The largest docking bays are still kept open for refueling and repairs, but the sections of the station that used to be living quarters have been sealed off.``This is a barely habitable frozen world. The Korath built nothing here except for a few small mining facilities, now abandoned. There is no sign that the occupants were forced to leave by violence. Rather, it seems that they simply packed up their things one day and moved out. The buildings they left behind are now half-covered by snowdrifts.``This small space station has plenty of blast marks on its outer hull, but they have all been patched and the interior still holds atmosphere. But although still intact, the station is entirely abandoned.`` For food, the Korath set up vats of photosynthetic yeast and bacteria in some rooms on the outer shell of the station. In their absence, the bacterial soup has worked its way through the ventilation system into the rest of the station and formed a thin layer of slime on almost every sun-facing wall.``The tiny sun that the Factory of Eblumab orbits is too small to provide much power, so the manufacturing plants here are mostly powered by nuclear reactors running on radioisotopes that are mined and refined locally. It is a hot, dry, and mostly barren world, and most of the workers here are young and single, hoping to build up enough wealth to move somewhere more pleasant.``Saryd culture places high value on connection to the natural world and to settings suitable for silent reflection. This is one of their most populous worlds, but even in the cities more land is set aside for parks and wild spaces than for buildings.`` Farther out from the city, the Saryds live in communal buildings that each house up to a dozen families, surrounded by gardens and cultivated forests. Unlike on many human worlds, here the most remote real estate locations are often the most valuable.``The weather on Far Home is a nearly perfect blend of what is most comfortable for each of the three member species of the Coalition. The mountains and boreal forests have been settled by the Saryds, the grasslands and savanna by the Kimek, and the rainforests by the Arachi, even though this is technically part of Saryd territory.`` This world is also home to the annual Coalition Games, where athletes from throughout Coalition space compete. The winners become eligible for immediate elevation to Heliarch rank.``The weather on Far Monad is actually rather pleasant. If it were not a lonely planet orbiting a dying sun in a region of space that few species visit and none claim for their own, it could have become a fruitful farming world or perhaps even a metropolitan center.``When the Korath were banished to the Core, they were left with only one living world, a planet they call Far'en Lai, meaning, the last candle-flame. Afraid that this planet's biosphere will turn to dust in their hands like all the other worlds they once controlled, the Korath have left Far'en Lai entirely unsettled and unexploited. It is rumored that the terms of their exile dictate that if Far'en Lai withers and dies, the remaining Korath exiles will be exterminated, but that if they can learn to make the planet flourish, their place in the galaxy will be restored.`",

A large number of small spires protrude from the hull of the station, each carrying fuel pipes, so that ships can simply dock with one of the spires to refuel instead of having to navigate inside a hangar.``Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry.``With enough money, you can buy a sunny day. Farseer is an ocean resort world, where much of the local tax revenue is spent on the terraforming equipment that moderates the weather. Real estate prices fluctuate wildly in times of political anxiety, because the idyllic climate exists only by government fiat.`` Industry here mostly takes the form of executive offices for interplanetary banks, law firms, and software companies. Strict zoning laws limit construction of skyscrapers or factories to the continents that are in the less pleasant polar regions.``In human space, this system would probably have been left unsettled, because its sun produces too much ultraviolet radiation for animals to survive for long on its surface. But the Hai have instead turned this warm ocean world into a massive incubator for photosynthetic algae and bacteria. Each species is genetically engineered to produce one or more medical or nutritional compounds that they can make use of. Barges travel slowly through the oceans harvesting these microorganisms out of the water and separating out the chemical compounds they provide.``Featherweight is a small world, with lighter than normal gravity. Centuries ago, because of its remoteness, this world was the site of some illegal genetic experiments, and rumors say that the current inhabitants are the result of those experiments. Because they are so well adapted to low gravity, few of them choose to leave, and very few outsiders choose to settle here, so this world's culture remains quite insular and detached from the rest of the galaxy.``Everything on this planet that is made of metal is overgrown with a thick layer of a reddish lichen or fungus. In the cities, the tallest buildings look like they have been melted or half digested by the fungus: tall towers lean at crazy angles, and smaller buildings are entirely buried and indistinct. The air smells like sauerkraut and roses.``Fenrir Station is a bustling refinery, and from the way the foremen looked at you when you stepped off your ship, they seem to be eager for new recruits. In addition to harvesting deuterium, this is one of the few refinery stations in human space which also collects helium-3, an isotope with some exotic uses in medical imaging and in energy research.`` The diversity of isotopes found here is partly due to the station being a relatively new construction and benefiting from modern technology. But the gas giant which the station harvests from also has a composition unlike any other known planet. One theory is that it is on the cusp of becoming a brown dwarf star, in which case the isotopes now being stirred into the upper atmosphere by convection will eventually be depleted by fusion.``The Unfettered are operating several large strip mines here to collect uranium and plutonium to fuel the generators in their warships. Older, abandoned mining pits are scattered throughout the planet's surface. As a result of the mining activity, the groundwater here has become badly contaminated.``This appears to have once been an inhabited world, and the remnants of a few cities still remain. But the planet's crust has been cracked like an eggshell, releasing rivers of lava and leaving behind unnaturally steep mountains and fault lines. The wind whistles and howls through the rifts and fissures as if the planet itself is screaming in pain. A thick haze of sulfur dioxide and ash hangs over everything.``The scenic fjords and rugged mountains make Flood a popular tourist destination. Nearly all the land in the planet's temperate zone is covered in mountains, making traditional agriculture difficult. The locals survive mostly by raising sheep and goats, plus a few native species, and grow fruit and vegetables in small terrace gardens tended by hand rather than by tractor. Most of the population is employed in the tourist industry, running inns for the visitors to their quaint mountainside villages, or making handcrafts for sale as gifts.``During the rainy season, the plants on Flowing Fields grow so rapidly that the grass can tower more than three meters tall. Although they look verdant and serene when viewed from a distance, the grasslands are also home to many dangerous predators, including hundreds of species of snakes and ferocious packs of carnivorous rodents that can bring down animals many times their size. During the dry season, the rodent packs build domed hutches out of woven grass and mud where they shelter from the sun and the dusty wind.`` Most of the Saryd dwellings are in the temperate forests, but they have converted almost a tenth of the grasslands into farms.``Follower is on the edge of the Paradise Planets region of space: not really one of them yet, but aspiring to be. It is prosperous, but from manufacturing rather than law or finance or venture capitalism. A significant fraction of the local taxes collected here are being spent on terraforming, raising global temperatures and reducing seasonal fluctuations. The goods produced here always have a ready market to purchase them, so Follower's job economy is considered very stable.`` As one of the few planets still actively engaged in terraforming, Follower has been the location of several experiments with new technology, trying to leapfrog the centuries-slow process that other worlds have gone through. Unfortunately most of these experiments have failed, sometimes spectacularly.``Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, but the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen.``Foundry is home to the Syndicated Shipyards, where more than half of the commercial freighters in human space are manufactured. Although much of the planet is blanketed in smog from the factories, there are also regions of pristine forests and majestic mountains. The Syndicate has a generous vacation policy on Foundry that allows workers to take as much as a month of vacation time every year, and many choose to take that time to escape from the cities and explore the wilderness. The shipyards claim that this vacation time is partly responsible for the high reliability of the ships built here, because a well-rested and relaxed worker is less likely to make the sort of mistakes that can quickly become disastrous in outer space.``In all of Coalition space, this is the one planet that comes closest to deserving being called a slum world. More than ten billion Kimek live here, mostly in densely packed and run-down apartment buildings on the outskirts of the cities. Unlike more prosperous Coalition worlds, the city centers here are reserved for factories rather than for parks or government buildings or civic centers.``Freedom is home to the oldest and largest anarchist colonies in human history. The original settlers arrived in the first century after the invention of the hyperdrive, coming with the goal of simply getting as far away from civilization as possible. The colony has reinvented itself countless times since then as different leaders have taken control, and in fact at present it is split into two separate towns, East Mesa and West Mesa.`` The environment is a mix of deserts and brackish oceans, with a fair amount of native wildlife and good potential for farming. Anywhere else in human space, this planet would have become densely settled, but out here it has remained mostly empty.``There are several large Hai cities near the equator on Frostmark, but much of the planet's surface is cold and uninhabited except by herds of extremely large, six-legged herbivores, and other equally large and frightening animals that prey on them.``Furnace is a nearly uninhabited world, used mostly as a waypoint for shipping and as a staging point for the Syndicate fleets that seek to keep this region of space free from pirates. The atmosphere is barely thick enough to be breathable, and none of the plants that grow here are useful for eating. However, because it is only a large moon instead of a full-sized planet, moving cargo and fleets of ships to and from its surface is fairly easy and inexpensive.`` Conducting any business here is a nightmare of tedium. Syndicate doctrine claims that corporate structure and process produce a leaner and more effective military force without the perceived wastage of the Republic Navy. But in practice, they seem to have combined all the worst aspects of military and corporate bureaucracy.``Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. For that reason, it has become one of the Republic's primary shipyards. More than half of the warships in the navy were constructed here.`` The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in clouds of ash and fog, so that being outside means being in a twilight haze with low visibility. Probably in compensation for this, interior spaces tend to be brightly lit and painted in bold colors.``Gemstone is a hot and unpleasant world, mostly due to a smoggy atmosphere high in methane. Much of the surface is covered in rugged mountains, making travel across land very difficult. However, the powerful tectonic forces here have created rich deposits of diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, which are mined both for use in jewelry and for certain electronic components. Mining a tectonically active world is an insane project, and earthquakes cause frequent cave-ins, but the potential of wealth draws miners here despite the high mortality rate.`` The miners are paid on commission on the stones they find. As a result most are dirt-poor, but the miners are full of stories of some distant acquaintance who became mind-bogglingly wealthy after striking a previously untapped gemstone deposit.``The rainforests on Gentle Rain are home to spiders so large that their webs are strung from one tree to another, and their typical prey is birds rather than insects. Another, equally large species of spider is able to leap four or five meters into the air in order to snatch a bird out of a passing flock. The rainforest trees grow so thick that except for occasional clearings, very little light actually filters through the leaves and reaches the ground, and during the rainy season the dirt is transformed into pools of stagnant mud.``Terraforming can change many things, but it cannot fix low gravity. Geyser was settled in the very first wave of space colonization, before refueling depots were available anywhere but Earth itself, so the only systems that could maintain trade with Earth were those that were only a few jumps away. Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`` In recent years, Geyser's economy has not been able to support repairs to the centuries-old terraforming equipment, and as a result the climate has become increasingly arid, and it is difficult to grow food crops here.``On this mining world, the Hai are using boring machines to drill tunnels straight into the hearts of the mountains. Each tunnel twists and turns to intersect the regions of rock with the highest concentrations of valuable ore. Most of the tunnels also join up with other tunnels that have been dug through the same mountains, so that there are multiple exits from any given point in the mines.``Glaze is a varied world with everything from sunny beaches to frozen tundra, but it is perhaps best known for its sandstone canyons and deserts. This world's wildlife has never been studied in great detail. Local rumors tell about an alien species of canyon people who live in caves in some of the deepest canyons, leading to a constant stream of visiting xenobiologists. The scientific consensus, however, is that these sightings have only been of a reclusive ape-like species that lives in the canyons, and is not known to dig caves or show any other sign of civilization.``The climate on Glittering Ice is so cold for most of the year that the creatures here have evolved thick layers of feathers, fur, or fat to keep themselves warm. As a result nearly all of them, from the smallest rodents to the largest predators, are practically spherical, appearing as shapeless blobs; for many of them it is hard for a casual observer to even figure out which side of them is their head.`` Colonies of one particularly clever species of large rodents that live near the equator are capable of using ice and snow to build interconnected, multi-layered warrens.``Elsewhere in the galaxy, people speak dismissively of the boughten sunshine that rich terraformed worlds can afford. On Glory, even many of the lakes and hills are artificial, crafted to garden-like perfection. Fittingly, the chief industry on Glory is plastic surgery, along with other medical efforts aimed at prolonging life, funded by rich, elderly folks who have settled here.`` Glory is also home to the Academy of Planetary Sciences, the organization at the forefront of terraforming research. The Academy takes on only a handful of apprentices each year, and guards its secrets very closely.``Although human beings who do not mind living in low gravity are welcome to settle here, Grakhord is part of Quarg territory, and has been terraformed to meet their environmental needs rather than those of human beings. The full extent of the Quarg mining operations here are not known, but rumors say that they have tunnels reaching down almost halfway to the moon's core, and Quarg ships can also sometimes be seen harvesting hydrogen gas from the upper atmosphere of the gas giant that Grakhord orbits.``````The islands and continents on this planet are almost entirely covered in marshes, rainforests, and (near the poles) dense coniferous forests, and the oceans appear green from above due to thick algae blooms and floating kelp mats. The overabundance of flora is caused by Greenbloom's major volcanoes, which constantly spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.``Greenrock is the closest thing that the pirates in southern human space have to a center of government, but taking the form of large, powerful corporations rather than elected officials. When rival pirate bands seek to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they meet. Nearly everything is for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves.``Greenwater is one of the few worlds in Hai space that is home to a sizable human population. The temperature on most of the planet's surface is too warm for the Hai, but tolerable for human beings. Close to the equator are scattered human settlements for farming or fishing, which trade with the Hai cities closer to the poles for technology and equipment.``Situated an ideal distance from this system's twin suns, this station holds greenhouses where the Korath grow a highly nutritious bacterial sludge that serves the exiles as their main food source. A few of the greenhouses are also growing more traditional crops, but these are clearly a luxury that the Korath cannot afford to waste more of their resources on.``This is the home world of the Hai. Well over half the planet's surface is oceans. The land is mostly covered by sprawling cities, except for some mountain ranges too high or too snowy to build on. Despite its population of nearly eight billion, Hai-home is relatively free of pollution or overcrowding.``House Chamgar claims that their advances in aerospace and weapon technology were instrumental in driving the Quarg out of Coalition space about six millennia ago. Given how much more advanced the Saryds and Kimek were at the time, their claims are likely an exaggeration. But, there is no doubt that in the present day the home of House Chamgar has developed into an industrial world as productive as any in Coalition space, partly because this world is rich enough in natural resources that there is little need to import raw materials from elsewhere.``The first settlers who came to Harmony were an Amish community seeking a place where they could live a quiet life and do work with their own hands instead of relying on machines and computers. Their community grew to millions of people, who now live side by side with other, more modern settlers. There are still regions of the planet where motorized vehicles are prohibited, but in other places trucks and horse-drawn buggies share the same roads.``Haven was founded by highly successful privateers nearly two centuries ago. Since then, as rival bands of pirates have fought over it, it has changed hands fourteen times, but has never been successfully invaded by the Republic. Numerous small manufacturing shops sell outfits that cannot be bought legally, and there is even a small shipyard where customized ships are sold to those who have the right connections.`` Much of the planet is desert, but with enough moisture to grow enough crops to feed the entire population. Strip mining has turned other parts of the planet into barren wastelands, and has polluted many of the rivers.``Haze is a manufacturing world, covered in sprawling cities. It is a relatively prosperous planet, but so far the inhabitants have chosen to spend more of their terraforming budget on climate control than on pollution reduction.`` Very few regions of this planet remain untouched by human hands, but a few of the particularly mountainous or marshy areas have been set aside as nature preserves. More than half of the indigenous life forms have gone extinct since human settlement began here four centuries ago.``Heartland is a pleasant world, with a geography mostly consisting of low hills, plains, and oceans. The farms here produce bountiful crops, and as a result it has drawn tens of millions of settlers. Many of them now work in factories or assembly lines, in which most of the farm equipment used here and in the surrounding systems is built. Tractors from Heartland are trusted to be well-built and sturdy, and easy to repair; some are still in use that were built over a century ago.``An extreme amount of tectonic activity in its distant past has left Heartvalley with mountain ranges five to ten kilometers high in some places. Most of the Hai settlements here are in the valleys closer to sea level, where the air is dense enough for them to breathe comfortably. The tectonic activity has left many ancient sea-beds exposed, providing access to bountiful supplies of oil. To the Hai, oil is too precious a resource to be used for fuel; instead they process it into plastic and use the byproducts in other chemical processes.``Helheim is not a pleasant place. Much of the surface is volcanic, pockmarked with craters and steam vents leading deep into the planet's crust. The air is slightly caustic, but breathable. However, it is also a world rich in easily accessible deposits of nickel, aluminum, and magnesium. The mining industry here has been booming for centuries, and in all of the Deep it is the one world where work is never hard to find - if you are willing to face the health risks and the lack of green and growing things.``Hephaestus is home to Syndicated Systems, which manufactures parts used in shipyards throughout human space. Although not always the highest quality or most technologically advanced, ship outfits produced by the Syndicate are quite affordable and sufficient for any ordinary pilot's needs. The executives of many other companies have been known to make a pilgrimage of sorts to this planet, to witness firsthand how the Syndicate has made their production lines here so efficient and dependable.`` Nearly all the inhabitants of Hephaestus live in a single metropolitan area that has spread to cover almost an eighth of the total land mass. As with many Syndicate worlds, pollution is a growing problem that they are working hard to address.``No one is permitted to settle on Hermes without a government permit. It is a sparsely populated world, mostly used for medical research and development - including some research that, if the rumors are true, are carried out here in isolation so that if something goes wrong, entire districts can be quarantined or even sterilized by orbital bombardment.`` The landscape is nondescript, mostly rolling plains and forests. The oceans are relatively small, and as a result it is a somewhat dry planet.``In the distant past, Hestia was a nearly lifeless ice world. It is now a sub-tropical paradise, one of the great victories from the heyday of planetary engineering back when the galactic economy had more money to spare for terraforming. Today it is mostly a retirement community for those who can afford it, although most of the population consists of young service workers in rented housing who take care of the retirees. On Hestia, the poor live in cities; the rich live in country estates. Aside from the urban centers, most of this world is covered in rolling green hills and oceans.``Hippocrates is a sparsely settled world, home mostly to scientific research outposts. The environment here, orbiting so close to a red dwarf star, is very different from most other settled planets. The scientists estimate this star system to be over ten billion years old, enough that life here has had much more time to develop and evolve than on any planet orbiting a brighter, more short-lived star.``In the year 2994, Hope was a somewhat cold but otherwise hospitable planet, home to a burgeoning population of almost two million people. But that year, a supervolcano eruption ejected so much dust into the upper atmosphere that a new ice age set in and the planet became unlivable. As the temperatures steadily dropped, nearly half the Republic Navy was mobilized to evacuate settlers from Hope and transport them to nearby colonies. The evacuation effort took six months.`` The abandoned villages and towns are now buried deep beneath the snow, and occasional treasure hunters come here to explore them and find items of value that were left behind.``Hopper is a temperate world of oceans, mountains, and plains, but with unfortunately high levels of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. Metal and stone that are exposed to the atmosphere corrode quickly, requiring frequent maintenance. As a result, Hopper has only a few small settlements on it, and most of the industry is focused on underground mining. The oceans are populated only by a few indigenous life forms that have adapted to their high acidity; Earth fish could not be introduced successfully here.``Huginn and Muninn stations, together, are the gateway to the Deep, the region of space north of here. The Deep was the first large region of space to have a democratic government, predating the Republic by nearly two centuries.`` Huginn Station is a prison station where convicted pirates must work at harvesting and refining deuterium to atone for their crimes against humanity. There are no services available for you here and the security guards, surprised by your visit and wondering at your motives, watch you closely.``The gravity is too strong on this planet for the Quarg to inhabit it, so they have welcomed human settlers instead. Many people who want freedom from the dangers of human space and the endless instability of human government have settled here. Although the regions near the equator are far too warm to be comfortable, the climate closer to the poles is almost ideal; the only reason Humanika is not as densely populated as some of the worlds farther to the galactic north is the distrust with which most humans view the Quarg.``This station is so run down that most of the workers carry oxygen masks in case a meteorite punctures the hull, and a few of them are even dressed in full space suits. The deuterium refinery here is barely operating, the number of workers is minimal, and nearly half of them seem to be busy just welding patches onto the hull to hold the station together. At the moment there are no repair or refueling services available here.``Icefall is far from its sun, but with an axial tilt of roughly 38 degrees. This means that the climate is cold, but the year is also long, and each hemisphere has a short summer - barely enough to fit a terrestrial growing season. There are only a few major towns, and no major metropolitan centers. Most of the inhabitants make a living as farmers, although near the equator there is also some oil drilling industry. Icefall's oceans are filled with constantly shifting pack ice and icebergs, making them nearly unnavigable.`` The most distinctive feature of the local ecology is the vast flocks of gooselike migratory birds, which raise two broods a year: one in each hemisphere's summer. The farm workers migrate in similar fashion, and many landowners have farms in both hemispheres.``Icelake is the second most populous Hai planet. Since its oil and natural gas reserves have long since been depleted, the large cities and factories here rely heavily on geothermal and wind energy. One fortunate side effect of that is that the air here is almost as pristine as on a non-industrial world.``Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong.``Inmost Blue is an ocean world, one of the first planets that the Kimek settled outside their own solar system. About two billion Kimek live on the low-lying islands and the one major continent, and the shallow ocean regions have been entirely converted into kelp farms. The Kimek take a utilitarian approach to food, and processed seaweed is a nutritious but highly unappetizing staple of their diet.``Formerly a fruitful farming world, this planet is now in the grips of an approaching ice age. The Kimek have chosen to wait it out rather than risking destabilizing the planet's ecosystems by trying to correct the temperature change, and the population has dwindled to less than a billion, mostly living near the equator where the climate is still somewhat temperate.``The world of Kaeyin now seems to be completely uninhabited, but it hasn't always been like that. Large, empty cities with towers of indescribable design encompass a portion of one single continent. The rest of the land remains almost untouched by anything not native to this planet, as if the buildings were simply lowered down onto the land rather than built up over time.``Karek Fornati was once a farming world, before global temperatures began to rise and the overworked farmland slowly deteriorated into deserts. The Korath who remain have dedicated their lives to finding a way to keep the sand seas from swallowing up the last of the fertile land, but without much success, and there are regions near the equator where sandstorms rage continually and no living things can survive.``This planet appears to have suffered irradiation when the neighboring star of Peresedersi went nova. The local flora and fauna are alive but still struggling to recover from the loss. Several large Korath cities remain. It seems that they were not able, or not willing, to evacuate the entire population in time to escape the nova's gamma radiation; sun-bleached bones are scattered in the streets of the largest cities.``The Kor Sestor apparently use this as a mining world, but rather than digging for minerals they have been intentionally crashing metal-rich asteroids into undeveloped sections of the desert where the robots can then break them apart and extract the ore. Predictably, the ecological effects of this sort of mining are devastating.``In this factory station, raw metal harvested in the other Korath systems is shaped into ships and weapons, the war materiel for their raids on human space. Sections of the ships are assembled and tested in pressurized hangars, but the Korath Raider is a large enough ship that the final assembly must be done in space, outside the station.``This is the Kimek home world. Before they developed spaceflight, billions of Kimek died either from famine or from civil wars brought on by overpopulation. Today, every major city still has hunger towers: kilometer-high skyscrapers where yeast and bacterial cultures are grown in massive vats in order to provide a bland but stable source of emergency rations if the crops and the food shipments from off-world should ever fail.``This small Korath station is positioned at the Lagrangian point in between this system's sun and the planet that the Quarg had been mining for material to build the ringworld. The station is dwarfed by the ringworld, but nonetheless manages to make a statement: re-asserting the territorial rights of the Korath in the face of an alien species that chose to build a settlement in one of their systems.`",
            "Spaceport": "` The Korath studiously avoid staring at you or even making eye contact, but you get the sense that many of them are quite curious about who you are and what you are doing here.`",

            "Description": "`The cities on this world have been hit by an astonishing variety of weapons. Some were leveled by massive explosions, while others show signs of strafing by low-flying ships or of orbital bombardment. Outside the cities, the land is fruitful and varied: forests, mountains, oceans, desert, and tundra.``This planet has a temperate climate, yet its surface is nearly lifeless, perhaps due in part to the high concentration of radioactive isotopes in the soil. The only plant growing on most of the land is a hardy bioengineered moss designed by the Wanderers to accumulate heavy metals and other toxins in its root system. These plants are then periodically harvested by flocks of unpiloted robots and buried in deep pits near the planet's poles.``This world is nearly unpopulated, with very little animal life and strange, twisted plants with odd coloration. In small patches of land, the native vegetation gives way to green forests and fields, which were probably planted there by the Wanderers. In some of the larger forests, birds and insects have begun to flourish.``Kraken Station is seven centuries old; it was the first space station built outside of the Sol system. The station has been modified and repaired so often since that time that in all likelihood not a single deck panel or bulkhead that was part of the original station remains. Four centuries ago it was nearly destroyed by an asteroid impact, but other than that it has been a working deuterium refinery for its entire lifetime.``This Quarg ringworld is almost half completed, but there are no signs of active construction, and your ship's sensors picked up no energy signals from any section of the ring except for this one. You also observed superficial weapon scars on some parts of the ring, damage that the Quarg have not bothered to repair - although clearly the attackers did not possess weapons powerful enough to do any serious harm to the ring.``The Quarg built this station centuries ago, before they began construction on the ringworld. From the dark side of the station, the ring is visible as a thin bright filament stretching out to either side of the system's sun. The ring itself is closed to human visitors, but tour shuttles depart from here on a regular basis, giving human tourists a closer view of this engineering feat that is so far beyond anything human beings have ever attempted to build.``This is an old factory world, so shrouded in smog that only tiny glimpses of the land are visible from above. Deep under the oceans of Laki Nemparu are oil reservoirs so vast that centuries of industry have not yet drained them dry. All but the hardiest of the native vegetation and wildlife is now long extinct from lack of direct sunlight or from pollution and chemical exposure.``Leviathan Station is the Deep's most productive deuterium harvesting station. Built nearly four hundred years ago, the station was one of the first to fuel the massive cargo caravans sent out from the Deep back when this was one of the only regions of the galaxy with a prosperous economy and a democratic government. Today it remains under government control, because the citizens of the Deep are wary of any private corporation controlling the industry that makes interstellar travel possible.``Lichen is a rainy world of marshes, fields, and streams. More than half the rice consumed in this administrative district is grown on Lichen, because of its near-optimal climate. However, because of the constant rain and overcast weather, few people aside from farmers have settled here.`` Planetary government, or indeed any government above the village level, is virtually nonexistent. Most farms are small and family-owned, negotiating sales directly with off-world corporations who then arrange for transportation of the produce.``Lodestone is a young, volcanically active world. The atmosphere is often filled with choking dust or sulfur dioxide, and new eruptions can occur with hardly any warning. Building any sort of structure here is an exercise in futility.`` The only reason Lodestone is inhabited is because of the planet's unusually rich reserves of heavy metals and other rare minerals.``Longjump is a mostly industrial world, with lower than normal gravity that makes it relatively easy to operate and transport heavy equipment. Hang-gliding is also a popular sport here, although for safety reasons it is prohibited anywhere near the spaceport.`` Longjump was the first planet discovered in the region of space known today as the Rim. Every year in the month of August, the Rim celebrates Han Sizer month, a whole month of activities commemorating the first explorer of the region. Wealthier citizens of the Rim celebrate by visiting as many Rim worlds as they can in the month, paralleling Han Sizer's month-long exploration of the region.``In the early days of space travel, back when engines were still so inefficient that escaping from a planet's gravity was costly and difficult, an enormous shipyard was built on the Moon where asteroids, harvested from the asteroid belt, were mined for raw materials for ships.`` The facility is still in operation, although it is now overshadowed by the far more advanced shipbuilding centers like Geminus in the Castor system.``Maelstrom is a stormy, geologically young world with towering mountains and frequent earthquakes. Most of the large cities are near the center of the planet's main continent, where the iron beds from an ancient ocean are exposed. Maelstrom is one of the chief exporters of iron, copper, gold, titanium, and other metals to Ada, where Lovelace Labs and the associated industries have a continuous need for raw materials.`` Extreme rock climbing is a hugely popular sport among the mining workers here, who have a tendency to be young, male, and reckless. The mountains are dramatic enough to even attract off-world climbers as tourists, though more than once a favorite climbing face has been sloughed off its mountain in an earthquake.``Mainsail is a water world: although there are some settlements on dry land, the largest cities are floating, artificial islands, which travel between hemispheres over the course of the year pursuing the most ideal weather. Other, smaller islands are privately owned by single families or corporations. Mainsail is a prohibitively expensive place to live.`` Centuries ago Mainsail was home to pirates of the old-fashioned variety, fleets of motor boats or even old-fashioned sailing vessels that would launch raids against the city-ships.``When families or young adults on Earth find themselves stifled by the crowded conditions on humanity's home world, Maker is where many of them end up. The Syndicate offers free transportation and housing in exchange for anyone willing to sign a five years contract to the mines or factories on Maker. The living conditions are often unpleasant, with young men and women packed into dormitories, and with those who are most in need of income taking dangerous jobs in the mines. Five or ten years of work will earn you enough to set up a homestead on any of the frontier worlds, and to many, those years are worth it.``Makerplace has an unusual degree of volcanic activity due to high concentrations of radioactive elements in the planet's mantle. Although it is warm by Hai standards, the abundance of geothermal energy, combined with plentiful solar energy and wind power, has made it an ideal world for manufacturing. Several cities in the temperate regions have populations of over a hundred million Hai, and the factories surrounding the cities spread out for dozens of kilometers in all directions. Near the equator, much of the land is desert or volcanic wasteland.``Mani is a small moon, with an atmosphere thick enough to keep your blood from boiling off but too thin to breathe without assistance. It is used only as a cargo depot and a spot for refueling and repairs. The native plant life mostly consists of pale-colored lichens and a few species of grass. The only animals are insects.``This mountain world is the home base of House Mallob, the powerful Arach guild in charge of commerce and shipping. All the Arach starships that are currently in use were designed here, and many of them are manufactured here as well. The motto of House Mallob's shipyards is strong as the mountains, spacious as the skies, referring to their focus on durable hulls and high cargo capacity.``Mars was humanity's first attempt at terraforming. Although it remains a dry, cold desert, the air is now breathable without an oxygen tank, and there are sections of the planet where a fair number of plants can grow. Because far more hospitable planets are available to those with enough money to pay for interstellar travel, the farms and ranches of Mars are run mostly by poorer Earth families who want to escape the pollution and congestion, along with some young adults who do farm work to help finance their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand on another world.``Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the galactic stock exchange are headquartered here, and so much money flows through this world's economy every day that the cost of utterly controlling its weather and climate is only a drop in the bucket. Not surprisingly, real estate prices here are astronomical; a small condo in one of Martini's main cities costs more than a capital starship.``A stormy world with unpredictable and rapidly changing weather, Mebla's Portion is nonetheless home to several billion Arachi and millions of members of the other Coalition species, in part because rent is cheaper here than on worlds with more idyllic weather. Many of the residents are artists or work in other creative fields that allow them to work from home on days when the weather is too violent for them to venture outside.``Memory is a dry world, but with enough local plants to maintain a breathable atmosphere. Some of the indigenous forms of cactus-like, drought-resistant plants grow dozens of meters high. Most of the animals that have evolved here are nocturnal.`` This planet was first settled only a few centuries ago, and the population is still relatively low, but they have developed a diverse set of industries including manufacturing and medical research.``This station was built primarily for harvesting hyperspace fuel. Even when the Korath were still here, the harvesting was almost entirely automated, so the station only has living quarters for a handful of people.``Mere is a world almost entirely covered by oceans. The locals live most of their lives on enormous ships, almost like floating cities, which travel around collecting fish and seaweed for food or harvesting pearls from the shallows to be sold off-world. The city-ships must do their best to avoid certain latitudes where hurricanes are most common, and even so storms are a continuous threat to anyone who lives here. Weather conditions are tracked constantly by a network of satellites.``This large station serves as the mission control for the robotic ships of the Kor Mereti faction. Warships of every shape and design are clustered in its docking bays or flying patrol outside.``Miblulub's Plenty was the first colony created by the Arachi outside of their home system, founded at a time when their home world could not produce enough food to reliably feed its entire population. This planet has long seasons and plentiful rainfall that make its temperate zones ideal for farming, while the grasslands near the tropics are mostly used for longcow ranching. Longcows are a distinctive and ill-behaved species of multi-legged cattle; their meat is a key part of the Arach diet.``Midgard is a world with as much geographic diversity as Earth itself: mountains, tundra, desert, oceans, marshes, plains. It was the second world in the Deep to be settled, seven centuries ago. It is now home to dozens of major metropolitan areas and a population of over four billion. Although a select few live outside the cities and work in farming or ranching, the vast majority of people here have jobs in manufacturing.`` Food, fashion, and entertainment here all strike you as out of pace with broader galactic culture. The deep independent history of the planet makes it less likely to simply follow the latest Earth trends as the more recent colonies do.``Wealthy Kimek prefer to live as close as possible to the centers of power, and in Coalition space the center of power is the Heliarch ringworlds. The dwellings here are a bit more luxurious and less densely packed than on other Kimek worlds, and the total population is less than two billion. Outside the cities, this is a hot forest world, without much local industry or natural resources.``Millrace is an overpopulated world, full of factories and manufacturing plants. It is one of several planets in this region of space where people trying to escape from the crowded squalor and polluted cities of Earth come looking for work. Most of the goods manufactured here end up being used by the Syndicate for constructing starships or driving industry on other worlds.`` The Syndicate is a fair employer: living conditions here may be squalid, but most workers are earning a living wage and some are able to save up for a new life on a more pleasant planet. The Syndicate trusts there will never be a shortage of new immigrants to replace them.``The Hai homeworld is orbited by a moon that is large and dense enough to have been able to hold on to its own supply of surface water, and although the atmosphere is cold, much of that water is in liquid form due to the strong tides. In a few places, granite and basalt cliffs rise out of the water, and the Hai have built a few small settlements on the moon, as well.``Moonshake is a planet of overpopulated cities side by side with dense wilderness. A few centuries ago it became a local center of industrial production when the Syndicate began building factories here. Since then, immigrants looking for steady work have been pouring in, doubling the planet's population every few decades. It is now a regional center for the production of everything from textiles to molded plastic parts to reactor-grade plutonium.`` It is characteristic of the Syndicate that the wilderness is entirely ignored, both scientifically and agriculturally, until it is plowed under to make way for expanding industry. Nowhere else in the galaxy is the local fauna so plentiful and yet so poorly characterized.``Muninn Station, along with its brother station Huginn, serves as the gateway to the region of space known as the Deep. They both harvest and refine deuterium for use as rocket fuel, and in addition Muninn Station is used as a military base for the local defense fleets.``Muspel is a hot world of deserts, canyons, and warm-water oceans. It is mostly a mining and manufacturing planet, and as a result there are few lifelong inhabitants; most of the people here are migrant workers who are just trying to save up enough money to settle down somewhere more hospitable.`` Some tourists also come here, to walk through the sandstone canyons where the wind and rain has carved the rock into tall pillars and spires. A few particularly beautiful canyons are protected against strip mining by local law.``Centuries ago, Mutiny was used as a sort of prison world for a powerful band of pirates, a place where rivals could be marooned or held for ransom, rather than killing them outright. It is a cold, dark planet, and food is scarce, but over time several villages developed in the more hospitable regions. No longer prisoners, the inhabitants who remain do so because they prefer a simple life beyond the reach of any government, on a planet that will never be stolen from them because it carries nothing of value.``The Saryd culture's fascination with the movement of the stars and planets can perhaps be attributed to the fact that their homeworld is orbited by two moons, which cause a complex and seemingly unpredictable cycle of tides as well as a variety of subtle effects on the circadian rhythms of the creatures that evolved on Saros. Saryd homes on other worlds often have night lighting cycles designed to mimic the moons of their homeworld.``Beneath Nasqueron's cloudy surface is a complex and thriving ecosystem of gas-dwelling organisms, from the massive void sprites all the way down to bacteria that inhabit tiny water droplets suspended in the air. Although the void sprites mostly feed on these organisms, it appears that in order to grow into their adult form or to give birth to young, they also need rare minerals that they can only find by feeding on asteroids, far beyond the planet's atmosphere.``Aside from fish, the Kimek diet is mostly vegetarian, but a few centuries ago an Arach entrepreneur decided to start ranching longcows here. It is an ideal world for ranching, with plenty of grassy fields. The ranches have begun a major industry, although generally only the wealthiest of Kimek are willing to spend money on longcow meat.``New Argentina is a world that is ideal for ranching but suitable for little else. Ranchers live as individual families or small communities surrounded by hectares of grazing land for cattle. As a result, the population is still quite low here, and the locals live isolated lives, with most families living many kilometers away from the nearest school or hospital or even from their nearest neighbor.`` Cattle handlers here do their work on horseback, because they believe modern vehicles are more likely to spook the animals.``New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry. For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.``New Boston is a completely unremarkable world... except, of course, for the fact that you happen to have been born here. Most of the land is wet and marshy, and the coastal regions are prone to flooding. Some food crops are grown here, but most of the farmers instead plant flax and jute, which grow well in wet soil and are used to make linen and burlap cloth. The textile mills are hot and poorly ventilated, but they offer higher and more reliable income than farming.``New Britain is one of the few worlds in the Dirt Belt region of the galaxy that is relatively prosperous and has a large population. Although the gravity here is slightly low, it is otherwise a nearly ideal Earth-like world, rich enough in natural resources that all the raw materials for the local industry can come from on-planet.`` Among the native life forms, the most striking are the many species of large and colorful birds, most of which have learned to give the cities and the spaceport a wide berth.``In the very early days of hyperspace travel, most settlers chose to put down roots within a few jumps of Earth, because until more fuel depots were built, colonies farther out would seldom be visited by cargo ships. As a result, a lot of effort was put into terraforming and developing worlds that would have been passed over by most colonists today. New China is one such world, and it is now overpopulated, and poor enough that maintaining the terraforming equipment and climate requires almost a third of the planetary government's tax income.``Due to complex atmospheric currents and swiftly changing seasons, the surface of New Finding is constantly scoured by powerful winds, making it difficult for soil to accumulate except in sheltered canyons and gorges. Each of these patches of greenery stands like an island amid a sea of bare rock. Over time, where the forests are able to take hold and grow, they spread outward and begin to turn more of the rock into habitable soil. On the exposed slopes, rock slides are a constant danger.`` Due to the limited habitable land, the local economy focuses on high tech medicine and equipment that can be produced by relatively small laboratories.``New Greenland was first settled about six hundred years ago, at the peak of the Turf Wars era where most planets were controlled by powerful corporations and their struggles often turned into outright warfare with privately owned fleets and armies. The people who came to New Greenland were looking for a world so marginal and undesirable that they could live here in peace without being caught in the crossfire. The locals here grow food in greenhouses and specialize in making warm winter clothing, which is this planet's only export.``Like its namesake on ancient Earth, New Holland is a world of oceans and low country. It is an old planet, its tectonic activity long since silenced, worn smooth by eons of weather. For those who live here, flooding is a constant threat, requiring a vast network of dikes and levees. But the floods also refresh the soil, making this one of the most fertile farming worlds in the region.`` As the population has boomed, and as the farms have been consolidated and become more mechanized, large cities have grown to house factories and workers.``New Iceland is a perpetually hazy volcanic world, with a slightly caustic atmosphere but enough reserves of metal and petrochemicals to draw a large number of settlers. Some of those settlers also make a living as farmers, and a few well-developed factory towns produce goods for export to other worlds.`` Many of the inhabitants wear dust masks to avoid letting the particulate matter from the volcanoes accumulate in their lungs.``New India was first settled less than a century ago, and the settlers are still struggling to establish themselves. It is a hospitable climate, but the amount of labor needed to clear forests and to plow rocky fields has meant that the towns here can only grow very slowly. The farms grow both food crops and cotton, and very recently they have begun manufacturing their own textiles instead of just shipping the raw cotton off-world for processing.``Wool clothing is considered a luxury in most of human space, because enough oil is mined on most planets to make synthetic clothing much cheaper than raising and shearing sheep. However, here on New Kansas, wool is the primary industry.`` The land is mostly rolling green hills and shallow streams, ideal for grazing. However, unwary travelers hiking through the idyllic countryside have been known to be attacked by savage packs of feral sheep, so this world is not without unique dangers of its own.``New Portland is a cloudy planet orbiting a dim star; the only reason it is not completely frozen is because of the heat trapped by its upper atmosphere. There are only a handful of towns here, and nothing big enough to warrant being called a city. Most of the settlers are subsistence farmers who can only dream about life on other worlds. Many houses here do not even have running water or personal computers.`` Some of the farms near the spaceport are planted with different crops forming abstract patterns visible from the air. Such a whimsical extravagance seems particularly odd when you consider that the owners will never be able to afford to see their fields from that angle. But perhaps that is precisely the point.``New Sahara is mostly desert and savanna, with very little precipitation. A century ago, some entrepreneurs settled here and built a factory complex that is entirely powered by wind and solar energy, because there are so few cloudy days here and the wind and sunshine are so reliable. The factory is mostly autonomous, with only a few thousand people living here to perform maintenance or to grow crops in irrigated fields.``New Switzerland is a world where tectonic activity has left deeply folded and fractured mountains across much of the planet's surface. In many places, the topsoil is too thin and rocky to support farming, but many people have settled here anyway, drawn to the beauty of the mountains. A few ski resorts operate in the mountains, and in recent years a gemstone mining industry has begun to develop as well.``New Tibet is a world of jagged mountains and deeply shadowed valleys. Although it has been inhabited for centuries, in many places the terrain is so rugged that roads cannot be built, leaving several of the smaller towns almost completely isolated. Taking advantage of this isolation, several orders of Buddhist monks have built monasteries here.`` In the lowlands, large farms support sprawling cities full of factories, a striking contrast to the simplicity and isolation of the mountain villages.``New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small.``New Washington is a planet huddled close to a dim, red sun in an otherwise frozen system. It orbits so close to the sun that the two are locked together, with one side of New Washington continuously facing the sun and the other in perpetual darkness. The only villages are in the twilight region in between, and there the settlers make a living by mining for metal and for oil, a relic of a warmer period when more life flourished here and the planet spun more quickly on its axis.``Newhome's gravity, climate, and geography is very similar to the Hai homeworld. Several billion Hai live here. Most dwell in large factory cities, but there are also ranches in the undeveloped areas where the Hai raise animals that are larger than elephants but produce wool similar to sheep. Shearing them is a dangerous undertaking, but their wool can be used to make excellent, long-lasting clothing.``Nifel is a cold world, with summers too short to grow most crops, and very little indigenous wildlife aside from thick-furred mammals, and some migratory birds that travel from one hemisphere to the other every year.`` Four centuries ago, when much of human space had been in travel quarantine for a decade to block the spread of the Rigellian Plague, it was here that researchers discovered a cryophilic bacterium growing in the permafrost that could be used to combat and eventually eliminate the plague. Some research labs and manufacturing plants still remain in operation here.``Nimbus is a stormy ocean world, where a rain shower can descend on you almost without warning, only to be replaced with equal suddenness by bright sunshine. It draws mostly the sort of people who can weather such changes with placid, unperturbed calm; tourist guidebooks often rank Nimbus near the top in their lists of friendliest natives.`` All the industry on Nimbus is driven by the sea. Fish are plentiful, and the oceans here also contain some unique microorganisms that are harvested to extract useful medical compounds.``Norn is a water world, with low gravity but an atmosphere dense enough to breathe easily. Large mats of seaweed and algae form natural rafts that drift around with the ocean currents, and a few intrepid settlers have colonized them, people who prefer a life of relative solitude and are willing to trust their fates to wherever the winds might take them. Others have settled the few, low islands, which are prone to frequent flooding. Fish are common here, including a few species of flying fish which travel in large packs and are a considerable nuisance for the land-dwellers.``Although much of Oasis is desert, a few tropical regions exist that are more suited to human habitation. The settlements are small, and rely mostly on agriculture, ranching, and textiles to produce goods that can be sold off-world. For those who are drawn to simple frontier living, it is a paradise, where you can earn a living just by working with your hands, and where the only mode of transportation anyone needs is a horse.`` Many outsiders, of course, view the Oasis lifestyle as backward and primitive.``Oberon Station is a deuterium refinery owned and operated by the Syndicate, and aside from a few docking bays for visiting ships to use in an emergency, the rest of the station is sealed off to non-employees.``The atmosphere here is a toxic mix of ammonia, sulfur, and methane. Although breathable by human beings if necessary, the locals use masks to reduce the risk of chronic respiratory problems. Even so, the life expectancy here is short, but that is partly because the two best-paying industries are oil drilling and mining for radioactive elements.``This is an Earth-like planet, a pristine and idyllic world with a large biodiversity. For millennia this was the de facto capital of the Builders, having both the largest population and being the most developed planet in this region of space.`` When the invasion broke out, Osaeli kept being devastated by the largest part of the Ka'het fleet until there was no safe place anymore and almost every Builder had been killed. But, soon after the attacks stopped, vegetation started growing around the ruins and slowly replaced the buildings there.``Thanks to their earlier exploration vessels, here the Builders encountered the first lifeforms evolved outside of their own planet under the form of some kinds of plants. Due to its hot climate the planet was only barely capable of supporting life, but the fruits the local flora produced were popular enough that Palarei became a major farming planet for many millennium.`` The farms on Palarei were one of the few successful Builder attempts at creating fully automatic facilities. Due to that, less than a hundred people were present here at the time of the invasion, who were quickly killed by one of the initial Ka'het attacks. Even now a few farms keep working, but only partially: there is no one to pick the fruits harvested, and the reserves now only attract wildlife.``Parii'het was almost finished when the invasion broke out, and already capable of (slowly) creating Ka'het. Thanks to the mining operations on Alix and the occasional harvest taken here by the youngest Ka'het, most of the facilities are still fully operational even to this day.`` Differently from most of the Graveyard, the station doesn't seem to have ever suffered any damage from the Ka'het, nor from the Builders trying to regain control over it.`",
            "Spaceport": "`The spaceport is a long landing strip paved in asphalt, with warehouses on either side of it constructed from stone and mortar. Inside are stacked lead-lined crates of radioactive materials for sale.

However, now it is mainly used as a hyperspace fuel refinery. Although it has endured some solar flares, constant maintenance means that the station still doesn't show it's age.`` Pelubta Station is also used to study one of the binary stars in this system, since it has a similar makeup and age to one orbited by a Heliarch ringworld. Most of this research is focused on predicting stellar phenomena, especially the most abnormal ones.``As with all refineries in the Deep, Phoenix Station is government-owned. You cannot imagine who would want to live here; despite reflective hull plating and active cooling systems, the station is uncomfortably hot. Nearly all the work is done by robots and computers, with only a skeleton crew of people supervising. Every time the station's orbit brings it through the planet's shadow, the temperature drops briefly and the entire station creaks ominously as it cools.``Pilot is used as a research and testing station for Lovelace Labs. The research buildings are not open to non-employees. From a distance it looks almost like a small war is going on, with missiles being fired from a silo toward a hilltop where an anti-missile turret is picking them off one by one.`` Rumors say that the Sidewinder Missile engineering team and the Missile Defense team are in fierce competition with each other, and whichever team is currently losing to the other must buy them lunch every Friday.``Placer is uninhabited aside from one small mining outpost; the atmosphere contains uncomfortable levels of ammonia and sulfur dioxide, and although brief exposure is not considered a health threat, those who live here must wear breathing gear when they leave their pressurized homes and mine shafts. Several scientific experiments over the last few centuries have sought to introduce microorganisms that would break down the harmful chemicals and transform the atmosphere to make it safer for human beings to breathe, but none have been successful.``Plort's Water is an ocean world, with no landforms except for some scattered volcanic archipelagos. A few of the larger islands are home to small Arach settlements, and others live aboard island-ships that can each carry tens of thousands of individuals. There is very little industry here, but many of the locals are involved in biological experiments or in categorizing the millions of species that inhabit the oceans.``Until very recently, Poisonwood was home to a slave colony run by a powerful outlaw cartel. Tens of thousands of slaves were forced to work in hot, dirty manufacturing plants or irrigating fields out under the burning sun. Finally, in the year 2985, a Republic Navy strike force defeated the cartel and liberated the slaves. The Navy also supplied the manpower and equipment necessary to transform the factories and towns into a more livable setting for those who chose to remain, while giving others free passage off-world.`` Today, most of the inhabitants are children of the liberated slaves, and like their parents they remain grateful and fiercely loyal to the Republic.``Poseidos is an ocean world, speckled with tiny islands. The people who live on the islands almost all make a living by fishing. The oceans are so bountiful that the locals say that only a fool or a very lazy person would starve here; there are enough fish even near shore that most families just own a small boat rather than the larger vessels designed for the deep ocean.`` The only scarce resource here is fresh drinking water. The village roofs are designed so that every drop of rain can be collected and conserved.``Prime is a very Earth-like ocean world, with a population of over a billion people. It is home to Betelgeuse Shipyards, and much of the industry on the planet is related to ship-building in one way or another, like refining and working metal, or developing exotic new hull and framing materials. Although some mining is done in more remote regions of the planet, Prime is reliant on shipments of metal and other goods to feed its industries.``This planet appears to be the Pug capital. Cities with impossibly high towers, connected by arches and bridges, are sprinkled across the landscape, and surrounding the cities are shorter, uglier buildings used as factories. However, a surprising amount of the land area is unsettled, its natural beauty untouched. Given how much damage humans did to Earth before discovering the hyperdrive, you find it hard to fathom how a species isolated in a single star system could have enough restraint to leave their home so pristine.``This planet has a handful of Pug cities on it, full of tall, graceful spires and arches. However, most of the land area is either left in its natural state, or in use for mining; it seems to abound in both oil reserves and metal ore. The climate is somewhat cold by human standards, but still quite livable. You are not sure if that is because the Pug were just lucky enough to have a star system with two hospitable planets, or whether they have employed some sort of terraforming.``This huge ringworld, built by the Quarg using most of the resources found near the Queri star, seems to be completely uninhabited. Occasional Ka'het passing near its surface shoot at the station's cover, doing no damage at all and seldomly leaving tiny scars. Everything inside the station is empty and unpowered, from its large rooms to its long, silent corridors.``Quicksilver is a world of highly variable, violent weather: hurricanes, hail, and earth-shaking thunderstorms. Under the planet's crust, it is equally turbulent and unpredictable, leading to frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity.`` Although Quicksilver has vast mineral resources, the tectonic activity makes underground mining far too dangerous. However, a few enterprising settlers work in surface mining and mountaintop removal. The results are ugly, but this is a far too inhospitable world for anyone to care what it looks like.``Rand is a desert world, too dry for much farming and with gravity low enough to be uncomfortable for most human beings. It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves.``Billions of Arachi live on this warm ocean world. It is home to House Debdo, one of the largest of the great Arach houses, which is composed of those who are employed in various service industries. This is a popular tourist destination not just for the Arachi, but for the Kimek as well and even a few particularly adventuresome Saryds.``This station is a refinery where ore from asteroids is processed into metal. Larger asteroids are processed where they are; smaller ones are brought into the refinery itself to be mined.``Relic was colonized over seven hundred years ago, back when the construction of the first hyperdrive was still in living memory. At this point, most starships had a very limited range, so the stars adjacent to Earth were the only viable options for any colonization attempts. Because of this, Relic seemed like it was going to become a major colony, despite it's low gravity, harsh environment, and limited resources.`` However, this would not last. In less than fifty years, the colonies had spread to much more favorable planets, and Relic was left behind by most human development.``Most Kimek are proud to be members of the Coalition, but those who are either suspicious of the other species or simply want to be as far away from the Heliarch ringworlds as possible when the Quarg return with retribution, choose to live here. As a result, despite its remote location this world supports a population of over eight billion. Many of the cities have defensive gun emplacements on their outskirts, yet another sign of the local paranoia.``Retilie is an oceanic world, where more than 95% of the planet's surfaces is covered by deep oceans that go down for many kilometers. The planet was mainly used for fishing, leading to a lack of infrastructural development. The few buildings that had been built on the coast lines were swiftly destroyed by the Ka'het and have since been washed away by the ocean waves. The ruins that remain are of a small city, well inside the mainland, far from where the oceans could erase it.`` In the oceans, the many species of fish continue to prosper, unaware of the destruction the planet has undergone.``Reunion is one of the most Earth-like planets found by the early settlers, all the way down to its moon and tides. It has grown into a mostly urban world, which supplies manufactured goods of all sorts to the neighboring systems.`` Local politics are unusually lively for a Republic world, to the point where a seat in the local legislature is often more hotly contested than one in the Republic Parliament. Topics of debate include trade and taxation, of course, but also seemingly fringe issues like biodiversity regulations for city green space. It may be that a world with no terraforming needs is focusing instead on tweaking society itself.``The Saryds are the only known species who successfully visited another world when their technology was still in the age of steam. The scientist who first landed here was piloting a ramshackle rocket ship of dizzying complexity. Modern analysis of his plans indicates that his flight had less than a one in ten thousand chance of success. This has led to speculation that he was either secretly assisted by friendly aliens, or completely insane, or possibly both.``This is the crown jewel of the Heliarchs, a ringworld that was completed by the Quarg before the Coalition formed and drove them away. It now serves both as a center of finance and trade, and as the seat of the Heliarch government, which is made up of elders who have been selected by the other Heliarchs from among their number in such a way that all three species always have equal representation. The Heliarchs, in turn, are selected from among the best and brightest members of each species. Despite the occasional resistance to it, this meritocracy has survived ten times longer than any human democracy.``This ringworld is the center of operations for the Heliarch defense forces. Although they have not had to fight a major space battle in thousands of years, they still maintain a sizable fleet, believing that if they ever allow their vigilance to waver, the Quarg may return and try to reclaim what was once theirs.``This Heliarch ringworld is their center for science, mostly trying to understand and reverse engineer Quarg technology rather than inventing new devices of their own. But after thousands of years of controlling these ringworlds, it seems that their inner workings are still something of a mystery to the Heliarchs.`` Construction work is always ongoing here, but rather than extending the backbone of the ring itself, which uses exotic materials that they cannot replicate, the Heliarchs are just adding sheets of solar panels and other extensions to the sides of the ring.``Rust is smaller than Earth, but very similar in climate. Much of its surface is suitable for agriculture, with wide open grasslands and dense forests. There are very few mountains, since the planet has low levels of tectonic activity.`` The chief industry on Rust, however, are the factories and labs for Kraz Cybernetics, a maker of robots, computers, and advanced weapons systems. The planet's population is not large, but the schools are among the best in the region, and many of the inhabitants - even those who live on the farms - hold at least one advanced degree.``The combination of a dry, temperate climate and its prestigious location near the Heliarch ringworlds make Rusty Second a highly desirable home for wealthy Kimek. Nothing is cheap here, and there is very little local industry aside from the banks, shipping conglomerations, and other corporations whose senior management offices are located here.``Long ago, this planet was home to several Korath oil mining settlements, but now all that remains visible are the tops of a few dozen of the tallest buildings. Everything else has been buried by sandstorms.`` Due to a recent shift in climate the deserts have begun shrinking once more, with local vegetation growing to cover more and more land each year, but the Korath are no longer here to benefit from the change.``It is unclear what the primary purpose of this station is. The station contains numerous greenhouses where a wide variety of plants, and even some small animals, are kept. Other parts of the station are closed off to non-Korath visitors.``This world is relatively hot and dry by human standards, but nearly ideal for the Kimek, and more than fifteen billion of them live here in cities where the skyscrapers are so densely packed that many of the streets never receive direct sunlight. The residential areas tend to be spread out along the banks of rivers, so the cities are linear, with factories and other industry on their fringes. Access to limitless skilled labor makes it cheap to manufacture almost anything here.``This was the seat of government and last military stronghold of the Kor Mereti faction during the Korath civil war. Here they built the factories and shipyards that churned out autonomous warships to prosecute their war against the Kor Sestor. The machines now rule this world alone, and have made it entirely uninhabitable for living creatures as they delve ever deeper into the planet's crust to harvest metal and fuel, and construct more and more factories to build new generations of robotic warships.``This planet's atmosphere has dangerously high radiation levels. On several of the continents there are patches, each nearly a hundred kilometers across, where the soil has been melted into glass by a nuclear explosion. Outside these blasted regions the plant life still flourishes, but the only land animals left alive are insects.`` In the oceans, bizarre and corrupted creatures frolic.``The homeworld of the Saryds still bears some scars from the adolescence of their species, particularly in its lack of biodiversity. But over thousands of years, they have returned significant portions of the planet to their original wilderness state. The planet's population currently stands at just over two billion, in part due to the fact that Saryds live very long lives and many of them choose to dedicate their lives to serving society in other ways rather than raising children.``This was probably a habitable world at one point. It is no longer. Nothing lives or grows here, and the atmosphere is full of toxic chemicals.``This is one of the primary war platforms for the Kor Sestor. Some sections of the station are much newer than others, and the scars are still visible in places where weapons fire has annihilated part of the station. The robots have rebuilt the damaged parts in a seemingly random pattern, like burls of bark growing over damaged parts of a tree.``From above this ocean world looks like a frozen wasteland, but a wide variety of uncanny creatures inhabit the rift valleys and hydrothermal vents deep underwater. The Kimek operate a small research station on the surface, because this is one of the few worlds in Coalition territory where there are still new species left undiscovered, kilometers below the frozen surface. Above ground, only a few species of birds and insects are able to survive.``Second Rose is a warm planet, but a bit too rainy for Kimek preferences. That, plus its relatively remote location, means that its population is low despite its fertile fields and fisheries: most Kimek prefer to live somewhere closer to their inner core of bustling metropolitan worlds.`` The planet's crust is rich in metal, and in some areas mine shafts have been sunk two or three kilometers below the surface to tap the richest seams.``More than ten billion Kimek live here, most of them living in one of several arcologies near the equator: massive structures that reach nearly a kilometer tall and may house over half a billion individuals. As a result, despite the large population most of the land is either undeveloped or used for farming.`` The Kimek arcologies are said to be able to recycle more than 99% of the waste produced in them each day, which is what makes it feasible for so many Kimek to live in such close proximity.``Grass and trees are scarce on this perpetually cold and foggy planet. The dominant form of vegetation is a mixture of mosses and lichens which can grow into mats more than half a meter thick. Vast herds of hoofed animals wander across the planet's surface, unable to stay in one place for long because the moss that they eat can take decades to grow back.`` The hardy plants that grow here are useful for producing a wide range of medical compounds.``A hideously powerful weapon tore open scars on this planet's surface so deep that pools of magma bled out through them. Presumably these wounds were inflicted on the planet by yet another Korath super-weapon devised in the final years of their civil war. A few ruined cities remain, some of which were sliced in two by the trail of weapon fire.``This station's hull is pockmarked by weapons fire and torn open by larger explosions. Only one section remains that still contains atmosphere. Inside are the corpses of a few dozen Korath, mummified by exposure to the dry and antiseptic air of the station. It's not a pretty sight.`` Before the war put an end to it, this appears to have been a refinery, processing ore harvested from the system's unusually dense population of metallic asteroids.``The most disturbing thing about the empty Korath cities on this planet is how pristine they are: no sign of bombing or of weapons fire. Either everyone who lived here chose to leave, or they were killed by a weapon that did no damage to the buildings they live in.`` Outside the cities, plant and animal life has begun to flourish, and some of the smaller villages have already been swallowed up by the growing forests. The climate is temperate, and rainfall is plentiful; aside from the reduction in biodiversity, it will not take this planet long to forget its former owners.``Seli'het was the only Het station the Builders ever completed, orbiting Giribea. Ka'heta are brought here once they reach the Age of Assembly; strange, lanky machines start molding an exoskeleton onto their bodies right away. As the Ka'het grow, their exoskeleton is expanded and various outfits are added, transforming them into living weapons.`` In this system the Ka'het behave differently than anywhere else, not only because this station doesn't have any visible damage but also because they don't attack each other, and some even seem to have started collaborating.`",
            "Spaceport": "`The spaceport city has a ring of searchlights perpetually pointed skyward to direct ships in to a landing in the fog in case their other instruments malfunction. Entire sectors of the city are off limits to non-Saryd visitors, and presumably are home to the secret research labs where advanced medicines and other technologies are being developed.`",

Smelting metal in a high-temperature blast furnace in the interior of a space station is, of course, an incredibly risky proposition.``Serpens is a sparsely populated world of ancient canyonlands and barren deserts. There were no permanent settlements here until a century ago when visiting biologists discovered an indigenous snake whose venom is useful as a painkiller and heart medication. That led to a few small laboratories being set up in the desert, and to the eventual discovery of other useful compounds that can be extracted from the local flora and fauna.``This is a Korath mining station, where ore extracted from asteroids is refined and processed. The Korath seem to have an aversion to harvesting raw materials from actual planets, preferring to work with lifeless asteroids instead.``This dry, hot world is home to almost no native life, but is ideal for the Korath automata because of its abundant solar energy. In the places where the Korath cities once were, the Kor Sestor have built massive factories with buildings sometimes close to a kilometer in height. In other places the land remains undeveloped, but the factories are constantly expanding outward.``There are several large Korath cities on this planet, but the ones farther from the equator have been covered by encroaching glaciers as the planet slowly enters a new ice age. A small number of crops are still grown in the open air, but many of the fields have now been covered with row upon row of gleaming glass as the Korath resort to greenhouse farming to lengthen the growing season and feed their remaining population more efficiently. Farther from the city, Korath ranchers tend herds of creatures that resemble giant, six-legged yaks.``Saryds are particularly drawn to forested environments, and as a result this world has become heavily populated. Rather than gathering in tightly packed cities with skyscrapers and busy roads, they have spread out evenly across the whole land area in a sort of endless suburban sprawl. But enough patches of forest have been maintained between the roads and housing compounds that from orbit, at a first glance, the planet looks pristine and uninhabited.``A dizzying variety of bizarre and stunted life forms have evolved on Shadowed Valley, each with different means of coping with the high levels of sulfuric acid in the planet's atmosphere and rainwater. In the mountains where cliffs and rocks are exposed to the acid rain, they have been sculpted into smooth, flowing contours etched with lines and wrinkles. But the Saryds prize this planet primarily for the beauty of its gypsum caves, full of delicate crystalline deposits, towering speleothems, and deep, clear pools of poisonous water.``Named after a mythical paradise, Shangri-La is an almost ideal planet, with a mixture of advanced, developed cities and uninhabited mountains. It is a rich and prosperous world, and nearly self-sufficient, but the cost of living here is prohibitively high for anyone from off-world. Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves.``This world is dry, but not particularly hot. The settlements are small and scattered, because each oasis only provides enough water for a few thousand individuals. Some of them focus on manufacturing, while others are attempting to farm the desert with drought-resistant crops. But the largest industry is retirement housing: the cool, dry climate and slow, quiet pace of life here are exactly what elderly Saryds find most comfortable.``Shiver is a dead and frozen world. The only settlement is a small refueling station that services cargo fleets on their way to Earth. Precipitation is rare here, but sometimes the wind whips up snow and ice from the surface into something akin to a desert sandstorm, and even on days when the wind dies down the air sparkles with tiny, floating ice crystals. Most people who come here for work only stay for a few months or half a year, just long enough for the sense of adventure to die away.``Shorebreak is an ocean world which is home to a stunning profusion of alien life, some of which is not too dissimilar from life on Earth. The first settlement, centuries ago, was built as a marine biology laboratory, and from there the planet gradually grew into a regional center for bioengineering, where local life forms are tested for possible use in human medicine.`` Outside the laboratories, much of the planet's land mass remains in its natural state, but the planet is currently struggling with a large increase in immigration.``Shroud is a world of castles in the clouds and slums in the valleys below. High on the mountain peaks, above the clouds, the planet's few elites live in splendid mansions. Below them, the people work mostly in textiles: farming cotton, raising sheep, working at looms and sewing machines in dimly lit factories.`` The level of intrigue and dalliance between the bored gentry could easily compete with the most lurid and unrealistic of Victorian fiction.``Eons ago, Silver was a lush tropical world. It is now mostly desert, but large oil deposits remain below the surface. The petrochemicals mined here are refined to produce plastics, fuel for terrestrial vehicles, and some components of medical ointments and antibiotics. The deserts are hot in daylight and surprisingly cool at night, and as a result most settlers live in houses sunk into the ground in regions where there is enough plant cover to keep the dunes from shifting in the wind and slowly burying their dwellings.``Sinter is a world where life never developed; the atmosphere is unbreathable, but warm enough and dense enough that people can survive here in pressurized homes or outside when wearing oxygen tanks. The only industry here is mining, which is mostly done with remotely controlled robots, so the population of the entire planet is only a few thousand people.``Siteria is the Builders homeworld, both the place where their journey began and where it ended. After a dozen millennia of underpopulation due to its closeness to the Quarg ring, the Ka'het invasion forced them to retreat. As one of the few remaining planets capable of sustaining farming and by far the one with the best climate, for a few centuries it had again the highest number of inhabitants of all the Builders planets.`` When the second invasion began, the large number of fields and farms around the planet allowed the Builders to survive for centuries, hiding in sparse strongholds. Almost three hundred years passed before the Ka'het were able to destroy the last colony.``Skillet is a sparsely populated planet whose red hills and canyonlands are strip mined for placer deposits of iron ore and precious metals, mostly to supply the needs of the shipyards in Betelgeuse. This world is also used for ranching, and even for growing corn in a few less arid regions. The weather is usually quite mild, although hot and dry; the only reasons so few people have settled here are because it is so remote, and because the mining and farming industries need far fewer human workers than machines.``Due to the low gravity here, some of the alien crops planted by the Hai grow to heights of five meters or more. The air is too thin for humans or Hai to breathe without carrying supplemental oxygen tanks, so the population is very small. The fields are tended by enormous spider-like robots which are equipped not only for irrigation and harvesting, but also for pollination, since the thin atmosphere has made it impossible for native insects to evolve here.``The dragons of Skymoot are an immensely popular tourist attraction, unlike their mythical namesakes only in their lack of ability to breathe fire. The presence of such an efficient apex predator has spurred the evolution of a stunning variety of defense mechanisms in its prey, as well; whether in the air or in the plains or deep in the forest, Skymoot is a dangerous place to visit.`` The scientific consensus is that the dragons are clever animals, but not sentient. Those who insist on trying to find ways to communicate with them almost invariably end up getting eaten.``Far beneath the swirling blue surface of Slylandro's atmosphere, void sprites and other strange creatures float about. As improbable as it may seem, the void sprites must have somehow evolved the capability to manipulate gravity fields, because every once in a while one of them will rise up from the surface powered by an antigravity field similar to the landing repulsors used by human ships. When they do so, the decrease in atmospheric pressure causes them to nearly double in size.``Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. But, it has since been taken over by pirates, who turned it into a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. As a hub of pirate activity, Smuggler's Den has access to fenced goods from beyond the region, resulting in repair shops that can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship. This confluence also provides the opportunity to buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners. Rumor has it that pilots with the right connections may be able to purchase heavily modified ships here.``Snowfeather is a world with unusually chaotic weather patterns, where snow can fall even in the middle of summer but will melt away within days when the temperature shifts and becomes warmer again. Surprisingly, it is a popular vacation spot for the Hai, who find the unpredictability and occasional violence of the weather here to be invigorating.``Solace is a fertile world that was already home to Earth-like vegetation and animals even before the first settlers arrived. It has now been inhabited for nearly half a millennium, and sprawling cities cover much of its surface.`` In addition to being one of the major metropolitan centers of the galactic South, Solace is best known as the home of Delta V Corporation, makers of plasma engines and rockets of various sorts.``The Korath were endlessly creative in devising new weapons of war during the twilight years of their empire, but what destroyed this planet in the end was not a military disaster but an ecological one. Small villages along the ocean shores and rusting fleets of boats bear witness to the fact that this ocean world was once a fruitful fishery. But now the ocean carries high levels of industrial toxins, and in place of large fish only small invertebrates remain.``This is a cold and mountainous world, and most of its oceans are covered in ice. A handful of giant craters gouged out from the sides of mountains are the only sign that there were once Korath settlements here. But, the Kor Sestor robots have begun building settlements of their own, in caverns deep under the mountains where they are safe from orbital bombardment. Where recent Kor Mereti attacks have collapsed one of the access tunnels, swarms of robots have gathered to dig them out like ants when their hill has been stepped on.``This is a relatively dry planet, and the only Korath cities were close to the poles where the temperatures are more mild and the lifeless deserts give way to grasslands and even a few scattered forests. The largest city was clearly destroyed by orbital bombardment. The other cities seem to have been done in by rioting or looting, leaving smashed windows and burned-out buildings behind. Some of the damage is very recent; the Korath survivors here held out for a long time.``Splashdown is an aging world where plate tectonics have long since died down and the weather has worn the surface down into lowlands, marshes, and shallow seas. Most of the land area is not suitable for growing anything but rice, and only a few settlements have been built here. Most visitors find this world boring, but the locals say they find beauty in the big sky and the subtle colors of the grasslands.``Starcross is a stormy, ocean-dappled planet that was not settled until the planets farther out on this arm of the galaxy grew prosperous enough to create a need for a stop-over point for cargo. Structures must be built strong and on high enough ground to avoid the frequent floods. A few enterprising settlers have taken up farming of some native plants that are edible for humans, including one plant similar to cranberries that has come to be considered a rare delicacy by many.``Starting Rubin was far from being the first station constructed around the Kimek homeworld, but it is the oldest one to still be on orbit. It was built as an orbital equivalent to the hunger towers found on the planet it orbits, as a safety measure against the disasters that may affect Ki Patek Ka.`` Since the residents need little of the food produced, it quickly became the station's primary export, transforming it into one of the largest trading hubs of the region. It has also the largest population of any Coalition station, capable of supporting tens of thousands of Kimek.``Cian Station orbits a large gas giant, which simultaneously has compounds usable in hyperspace fuel and enough mass to pull an abnormally large numbers of asteroids near it. The local industry mostly centers around the metals harvested here, but part of it is still focused on refining deuterium. Its remote location prevents it from becoming a major port, but most traders that travel into this region stop here, even if just to refuel and to watch its impressive facilities. This is also the most recent Coalition station, although it's much older than any in human space.``Stonebreak is home to some of the largest cities in Hai space aside from their homeworld: massive planned communities built in concentric rings, where housing space and community buildings alternate with zones of factories and shipyards. This star system has an unusual number of metallic asteroids, which the Hai harvest for the raw materials for Stonebreak's industries.``A cold planet, with dense, foggy atmosphere. As with many pirate outposts, Stormhold is home to an unknown number of villages and hidden outposts, each controlled by a different pirate faction. It is also said that some of the most dangerous fugitives in the galaxy live deep in the forests of this planet, escaping detection by living underground or by avoiding the use of electronic devices.``The Stronghold of Flugbu was used as a military base during the War of Independence. Now it is a manufacturing world, specializing not in large machines but small, intricate components. It is also home to House Bebliss, the secretive guild that specializes in communication, translation, and encryption. House Bebliss is essential to the Coalition economy because they maintain the hyperspace communication network, but there are also rumors that they may have ties to the Resistance.``Sundive is largely covered in tropical rainforests and savanna, but with enough open plains that it has also become a major agricultural world. For most of the year, the weather here is quite mild, but tornadoes and massive thunderstorms are not uncommon in the summer months.`` Sundive is also home to a large astronomical laboratory with radio telescopes and other devices for studying the galactic core and the massive black hole that resides there.``Most of this world is barren deserts and oceans; for whatever reason almost no life evolved here. The only human settlement is a small town in one of the few hilly regions, and the locals survive by ranching and farming. It is the sort of world that is ideal for people who enjoy being alone, because it has almost no appeal for anyone else. In addition to the oppressively hot weather, flash floods are quite frequent.``Sunracer is home of Megaparsec, Inc., a shipyard that specializes in designing fast, lightweight ships. It is a well-settled planet with a population of nearly half a billion, and a diverse economy that includes farming and fishing in addition to the shipyards.`` Outside the cities, large regions of undeveloped land still remain. Hovercraft racing is a major local sport, and some massive and elaborate courses have been constructed in the wilderness.``This world is home to House Garbarag, the Arachi guild of farmers and ranchers. On private ranches far from the cities, they experiment with raising new breeds of longcows, a unique species of cattle that grow a new body segment each year and can reach more than thirty meters in length. The meat from a single longcow can feed a village for a month.`` Longcows are typically docile and slow-moving, but when frightened one of them can do as much damage as an entire herd of stampeding terrestrial cattle.``This station is run down and completely abandoned, emptied of atmosphere so that air pressure will not put ongoing stress on the station's structure. Each section is sealed off from the others by heavy blast doors, leaving most of the station inaccessible.``This cool, dry world is a sort of natural cleanroom, an ideal place for manufacturing sensitive equipment that could be harmed by the presence of condensation or mildew or pollen granules. The factory workers and overseers live in hive-like dormitories that each house tens of thousands of Kimek.`` Closer to the poles, the air is too cold to be comfortable for the Kimek, but a small community of Saryd engineers has established a factory compound where they produce their own equipment to sell to the Kimek.``Thrall has a warm, moderate climate and a geography of mostly gently rolling hills. Most of the industry here takes the form of agriculture, especially growing cotton. There are also three major cities where the cotton is spun into thread and woven into textiles for export off world. It is one of the few places in the galaxy where cotton is picked by hand, because labor here is cheaper than the cost of buying and maintaining machinery.`` The locals are prevented from seeking more lucrative employment elsewhere partly by the crushingly low wages, which make the cost of space transport prohibitively high for most, and partly by the educational system, which is among the worst in the galaxy.``Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so. It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed.``When the first colonists landed, they thought that they had found a dream world on Thunder: perfect gravity, perfect temperature, perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, they soon discovered that the planet has unusually high tectonic activity, enough that building anything higher than two stories is almost impossible. Because of the earthquakes, attracting settlers has always been difficult for Thunder, and right now the population is only a few million.``This world is uncomfortably hot, even for the Wanderers, and so close to its star that the surface is bathed in dangerous levels of ultraviolet light. The few Wanderer installations here are buried underground, with only a few access hatches and storage buildings on the surface.``Tinker is a highly industrialized world, exporting electronics both to the Syndicate and to Earth. The electronic goods manufactured here span the gamut from wires and capacitors to sophisticated microchips, and because many of the jobs here require skilled labor, it is a relatively prosperous planet.`` Outside the cities, large areas of this world have been set aside for mining and for refineries and smelters, ensuring that the industries here have all the raw materials they need, plus extra to sell.``In a region of the galaxy not known for beach resorts, Trinket has become somewhat of a major tourist destination. It is not a particularly warm world, and near both poles icebergs float year round, but at the equator the weather is almost tropical and the water is warm enough for swimming. Occasionally one of the ocean currents will pick up an iceberg and carry it all the way down past the resorts before it melts completely; taking a boat out to these icebergs is a popular daytime activity here.``Triton Station serves both as a refinery for hyperspace fuel, and as a garrison for ships of the Republic Navy. Patrol ships are constantly landing here and then taking off to scour the surrounding systems for pirates. Since pirates are scarce in this part of space, it seems like a very tedious job.``Trove is a tiny world, too small to have a breathable atmosphere. It is home to an experimental jack mining operation that has split its surface open in order to gain access to the metal-rich core. Most of the work here is done by machines, but a few people live inside an airtight complex in order to supervise the work and to sell ore and metal to visiting ships.``Millions of years ago, this was a warm world, perhaps even tropical. But some cataclysmic event, perhaps a meteor strike or a massive volcanic eruption, altered the planet's atmosphere enough to turn it into the nearly lifeless, frozen planet it is today.`` The first settlers came here to drill for the oil trapped deep under the surface, a relic of Tundra's former, more lively days. Instead of refining the oil into plastic, which sells relatively cheap in this region, they have developed an industry in synthetic fabrics and clothing.``The offshore kelp farms on Turquoise Four produce not only nutritional food, but also an ultra-strong fiber that is used for creating durable textiles. Farther from shore, the Kimek operate fish farms as well. Viewed from above, the ocean surface is divided into patches of deep blue or green or rusty brown depending on what sort of product is being farmed in each patch.``The only settlement on this small world is Twinstar Depot, a village created mostly just to service the spaceport, where food and equipment from the southern galactic arm is stored and sent out in all directions to supply the rest of human space. The gravity is far less than ideal for human development, but the atmosphere is breathable and some tourists come to the planet just for the experience of being able to run and jump in low gravity without the need for a suit or oxygen tanks.``Typhon Station is one of the major fuel refining stations in the galactic Rim. It is privately owned by Southbound Shipyards, and all the fuel produced here is shipped directly to them rather than being made available to visiting ships.``Vail is an entire world that is maintained as a ski resort for rich clients from the nearby planets. A combination of terraforming and snow making ensures that whichever hemisphere is in winter always has ideal skiing conditions, while farming and other small industries supply the tourists and the large staffs that cater to them. The slopes here include tracks for all the latest dangerous and expensive extreme winter sports, like hoverboarding and wingsuit cliff skiing.``Valhalla was the first world to be settled in this region of space, which is known as the Deep. It is rich in natural resources, but all its vast farms and fisheries are insufficient to feed its population of nearly five billion.`` The shipyards of Lionheart Industries are located here. Centuries ago, warships built here turned the tide of the Alpha War, and today the ships designed and built in the Deep continue to be some of the most technologically advanced ships in human space - and the most expensive.``This is a populous Wanderer world, with small farming villages scattered across all the land, and even a few larger population centers that might almost qualify as a city. But from the air, it is not evident at first that the planet is so heavily settled, because the village tree-houses are mostly hidden beneath the forest canopies. The farms, too, are almost indistinguishable from natural land, due to a permaculture system where many varieties of plants are growing side by side.``This is an Earth-like world with one major Wanderer city and countless smaller settlements. The settlements mostly consist of tree-houses built high up in living trees. The architecture of the city skyscrapers is full of cantilevered balconies and arches, mimicking the natural shape of a forest. Here and there a bit of smoke or steam rises from what must be a factory or power plant, but most of the land outside the city is green fields and pristine oceans.``The surface of this small icy moon is constantly cracked and broken by tidal force from the gas giant that it orbits. The tidal disturbances also heat the moon enough to keep its oceans warm enough to support life despite the small amount of sunlight that reaches here.``This is the most populous Wanderer world, with dozens of large cities. The tallest buildings branch and cantilever out from their bases like metallic trees. More than half the surface of the planet is ocean, with a few small settlements built on massive living rafts of algae and seaweed, perhaps ten meters thick and up to several kilometers wide. Much of the land is forests, with villages built entirely in the treetops.`` There are also farms here, but more like gardens or parks than a human farm: each with dozens of species of plants growing side by side, and harvested by autonomous robots.``The surface of this world is almost entirely ocean, and the Wanderers who inhabit it live on massive floating algae mats, some of them the size of a small city. Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming.``This is a desert world, but the Wanderers are working little by little to make the desert bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes.``This is a farming world, but the primary crops are medicinal plants rather than food: fields of brightly colored flowers and delicate shrubs. Large factories near the farms process the raw plants and extract useful chemical compounds. Their gleaming metal smokestacks belching steam into the air seem incongruous amid the natural beauty and bright colors of the fields of flowers.``Vara Pug is an ocean world, wild and almost unsettled, except for a single Pug city on the coast of one of the major continents. The animals and plants on the land are relatively uninteresting, but the oceans are home to an enormous variety of creatures, including whales the size of a bulk freighter, a highly intelligent species of jellyfish, and other, far stranger creatures that rarely venture up from the sunless ocean depths.`` To avoid contact with these marine creatures, when the Pug travel to other parts of the planet they use massive solar-powered airships rather than boats.``This is one of those rare worlds whose climate is already nearly perfect without the need for terraforming. The Wanderers have made it into a farming planet. The fields follow the natural contours and geology of the land rather than being laid out in rectangular lots like most human farms, and each field contains several different crop species designed to form a symbiotic ecosystem.``The Wanderers harvest metal ores not from planets, but from asteroids, in order to not expend even more of the resources of the planets that are under their care. This star system contains an unusually high concentration of metallic asteroids, and as a result they have built many large refineries here to process the ore that their drones harvest.``Varu K'est is a spare, ancient planet of arid plateaus and deep, meandering canyons, with too little rainfall to support any but the hardiest of shrubs. The Wanderers have converted nearly all their villages on this planet into military bases in order to oppose the encroaching Hai raiders, and have also been forced to postpone their attempts at improving the local ecology.``This is one of the only Wanderer worlds that still has large reserves of oil, albeit deep below the ocean surface where mining is difficult. Aside from the drilling companies and refineries, the largest local employer is the local government's safety oversight department, whose inspectors are constantly visiting the drilling platforms and shipping hubs to ensure that all the regulations for preventing oil spills are being followed.``This Wanderer factory world is now home to more abandoned villages than populated ones: entire factories rusting and decaying as a result of the recent threat from the Unfettered Hai. Most of the factories that remain active have been repurposed to produce weapons or ammunition for the defense of Wanderer space.``This Wanderer world is almost uninhabited and devoid of any indigenous ecosystem, except perhaps on the microscopic level. It has none of the beauty of other Wanderer settlements. Here, factories have been built to process the most dangerous and destructive of industrial chemicals. If disaster strikes one of the factories, the only result will be the contamination of a world that is already dead and lifeless - far better, in the judgment of the Wanderers, than allowing such risky industries to operate on a living world.``This is a desert world, too hot and too close to its sun to support much animal or plant life. The Wanderers have covered large stretches of the desert with solar-powered factories: smelters that use the sun's reflected heat to melt ore, and fields of solar panels that support other industries.``Due to strong currents and extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations, the oceans of Vibrant Water are dotted with icebergs that can drift almost as far as the tropics before melting. The largest icebergs are more than a dozen kilometers across and are home to entire ecosystems ranging from ice-dwelling insects to sea birds to large seal-like mammals. Beneath the ocean surface shoals of fish, forests of kelp, and drifting clouds of algae provide a continuous food source for the creatures that inhabit the icebergs.`` Near the equator, the Saryds farm several species of engineered algae.``This cold and dreary world would certainly not be attractive to any modern settlers, but to those who were fleeing the chaos of the Alpha Wars it had the undeniable advantage of being isolated and undiscovered. Today the main reason for the continuing Remnant presence here is that this is the only world they have found where the key stones that enable ships to travel through certain wormholes in the Ember Waste can be found.``Many centuries ago, some of the first settlers on Vinci included a small group of electrical engineers who formed a revolutionary new company for designing computers and microchips. Today, Vinci is the foremost manufacturer of CPUs in all of human space, and their processors are found in everything from navigational computers to video phones to intelligent toasters. Because this world is home to so many cleanroom fabrication plants, pollution is very tightly controlled.``Warfeed is mostly covered in oceans, and much of its land area devoted to agriculture. Most of the fields are tilled and harvested by robots, but there are also many scattered homesteads of subsistence farmers, who survive with the aid of little or no technology.`` In recent years, both the land and the seas of Warfeed have begun to show the toll of centuries of overharvesting. Large portions of the continents near the equator are now nothing but growing deserts, and even the best remaining farmland is sandy and nutrient-poor. All but the smallest marine organisms have been nearly fished to extinction.``This is an ideal world, by Saryd standards: rugged, hilly, mostly forested, with oceans and land masses in equal proportions. It serves mostly as a residential world, because this system's heavy industry is focused on the automated factories on its sister world of Ceaseless Toil.``The tropical rainforests of Warm Wind are unusual: instead of rivers on the surface, water flows through intricate underground networks of caves that span entire continents. The trees have evolved deep and strong roots that can pierce through the limestone into the subterranean rivers in order to draw a constant supply of water even in the dry seasons. The Saryds have explored only a tiny fraction of the caves.``Watcher is a small moon, the only world in this system that sustains any indigenous life. Because of the low gravity, humans have not yet built a permanent settlement here, but it is occasionally visited by biologists interested in studying low-gravity life forms. There are forests here where the trees grow over two hundred meters tall.``Wayfarer was initially settled by a team of scientists and diplomats seeking to build a relationship with the Quarg worlds to the galactic southeast of here. Partly through the aid of the Quarg and partly through a desire to emulate them, it has grown into a very technologically advanced world.`` Tarazed corporation, a maker of alien-inspired ships and outfits, is one of the largest industries on Wayfarer, and they draw raw materials from throughout this region of space.``The Weir of Glubatub is a quiet ocean world, lit by a dim red sun, whose atmosphere seldom gathers enough energy to spawn storms or other violent weather. Nearly all the life in the oceans is very close to the surface, where the sun's light is bright enough for algae and seaweed to flourish.`` A few of the larger islands have been settled by the Arachi, and most of the locals work in the fishing industry. Some of the fishing boats are so large that a small starship can land on their decks.``Nearly three quarters of the surface of Windblain is ocean. Most of the industry here centers around petrochemicals: deep sea oil drilling, refining, and manufacture of plastic composites and synthetic fabrics for clothing. There are a few large cities on the continents, but also plenty of wilderness spaces as yet untouched by human activity.`` The local climate and economy are neither good enough to attract immigration, nor bad enough to drive people to leave. There seems to be almost no interest in the affairs of the wider galaxy.``The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`` The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`",

It has also been a continuously operating hyperspace fuel refinery for more than three centuries.``Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`` Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.``Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture.`` The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards, which focuses on designing well-defended merchant ships to survive the pirates that are so common here.`",
            "Spaceport": "`The spaceport of Zug has been growing by amalgamation for centuries. At its core is the Old Port, a set of quaint and rudimentary shops and warehouses. The landing pads for the Old Port were torn up to make room for what the locals call The Port, a set of buildings that were constructed a century ago, with bolder architecture and more modern design. Some distance away is the New Port, a towering structure with robotic cargo lifts and large hangars for more expensive ships. Meanwhile, plans are apparently underway for an expansion of the New Port. You can't help but wonder what the new expansion will be named.`",
